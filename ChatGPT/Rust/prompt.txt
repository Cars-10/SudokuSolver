    You are an expert software developer and write clean and efficient code.
    I want you to write a Soduko solver in Rust.
    I will outline each procedure to write:
    Please write the complete code, I do not what to see placeholder functions.
    Please add comments that identify the code for each step below.
    Make sure the code you provide will compile without errors or warnings.
    Step 1: Write a function that reads a 9x9 space seperated matrix from a file and returns it as a 1D array,
    please also ignore comments.
        Print the board after it is read and when it is solved.
    Step 2: Write a function that calculates the complexity of a 9x9 matrix.
    Step 3: Write a function that will print the board in a 9x9 grid.
        Print the complexity only for the unsolved board
    Step 4: Write a function that will solve the Soduko board using a backtracking algorithm.
    Step 5: When solved print the final board and the number of iterations, using commas for thousands.
    step 6: The matrices to read will be submitted on the commandline.
    Check the 3x3 square for the number, before backtracking
    Please follow each step slowly and carefully, I will be checking your work.
    Make sure to print the  complexity and the number of iterations.
    Write the complete code with comments, make sure that it will properly compile and run. Please
    reply with code only in JSON format, no need for addtional information.
