# Ralph Progress Log
# Feature: Fix Runtime Error Languages
# Branch: ralph/fix-runtime-errors
# Started: 2026-01-08

## Codebase Patterns
- Languages are in Languages/<name>/ with runMe.sh entry point
- runMe.sh must set SOLVER_BINARY to an executable that accepts matrix path as $1
- For complex invocations, create wrapper scripts (e.g., run_make.sh, run_fsharp.sh)
- Use check_toolchain <cmd> to verify tool availability
- Matrix 1 reference iterations: 656
- Docker container: sudokusolver-app-1
- Test command pattern: docker exec -w /app/Languages/<lang> sudokusolver-app-1 ./runMe.sh ../../Matrices/1.matrix
