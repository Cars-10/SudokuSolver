## Codebase Patterns
- TypeScript files use ES2022 modules with `import * as fs from 'fs'` pattern
- Use `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` for ESM __dirname equivalent
- Run scripts with `npx tsx scripts/script.ts`
- Each Language folder has its own metrics.json with structure: `[{solver, runType, timestamp, results: [...]}]`
- Typecheck per folder with `npx tsc --noEmit` in folder with tsconfig.json
- Cross-folder imports between Metrics/ and scripts/ folders don't work - inline or duplicate code instead
- Charts use D3.js (d3.v7), NOT Chart.js - included via CDN in HTMLGenerator.ts
