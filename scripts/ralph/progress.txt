# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Thu Jan  9 06:50:00 CET 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `check_toolchain <toolname>` in compile() to gracefully report env_error when toolchain missing
- runMe.sh scripts should source ../common.sh and define LANGUAGE, SOLVER_BINARY, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS
- README.md should document package requirements with apt install commands
- Test with matrix 1 first (656 iterations is the expected count)
- Always add `cd "$(dirname "$0")"` at the start of runMe.sh

## 2026-01-09 06:50 - US-001 (Ada)
- Verified Ada implementation was already properly configured
- gnatmake exists in Docker at /usr/bin/gnatmake
- runMe.sh already has proper structure
- README.md already documents gnat requirement
- Tested: 656 iterations (correct)

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-002 (Assembly)
- Both x86_64 (Sudoku.asm/NASM) and ARM64 (Sudoku_arm64.s/GCC) variants already exist
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS
- Updated README.md with requirements section
- Tested on ARM64: 656 iterations (correct)

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-003 (BASIC)
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, simplified compile()
- Created README.md documenting FreeBASIC (fbc) requirement
- fbc installed in Docker at /usr/local/bin/fbc
- Tested: 656 iterations (correct)

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-004 (Crystal)
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, proper compile()
- Crystal not installed in Docker - properly reports env_error
- README.md already exists

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-005 (C#)
- Root cause: Sudoku.csproj targeted net9.0 but Docker has .NET 8.0 SDK
- Fixed by changing TargetFramework from net9.0 to net8.0
- Build now succeeds
- runMe.sh was already properly configured

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-006 (Fish)
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, simplified to use check_toolchain
- Created README.md documenting fish requirement
- fish installed in Docker at /usr/bin/fish
- Runs successfully

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-007 (Jupyter)
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, simplified compile()
- Created README.md documenting jupyter/nbconvert requirement
- jupyter installed in Docker at /usr/local/bin/jupyter
- Tested: 656 iterations (correct)

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-008 (Ksh)
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, use check_toolchain
- Created README.md documenting ksh requirement
- ksh installed in Docker at /usr/bin/ksh
- Runs successfully

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-009 (Objective-C)
- GNUstep is installed in Docker
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, better error handling for GNUstep
- Created README.md documenting requirements for macOS and Linux
- Tested: 445778 iterations on matrix 5 (correct)

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-010 (Smalltalk)
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, use check_toolchain
- Created README.md documenting gnu-smalltalk (gst) requirement
- gst not installed in Docker - properly reports env_error

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-011 (Vimscript)
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, use check_toolchain
- Created README.md documenting vim requirement
- vim installed in Docker at /usr/bin/vim
- Runs successfully

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-012 (XSLT)
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, use check_toolchain
- Created README.md documenting xsltproc requirement
- xsltproc installed in Docker at /usr/bin/xsltproc
- Runs successfully

---

## 2026-01-09 - US-013 (Zsh)
- Fixed runMe.sh: added cd, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS, use check_toolchain
- Created README.md documenting zsh requirement
- zsh installed in Docker at /usr/bin/zsh
- Runs successfully

## Summary
All 13 user stories completed:
- 11 languages now run successfully in Docker
- 2 languages (Crystal, Smalltalk) properly report env_error (toolchain not installed)
- All runMe.sh scripts follow consistent pattern
- All languages have README.md with requirements documented
