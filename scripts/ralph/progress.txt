## Codebase Patterns
- TypeScript typecheck has a pre-existing ScreenshotUtils.ts error (window not defined) - this is expected and can be ignored
- The expand-chevron was the mechanism for expanding language rows; now removed, rows only show modal on click

## 2026-01-10 - US-002
- What was implemented: Reduced table column widths to fit within viewport
- Files changed:
  - Metrics/index.css: Reduced th/td padding from 15px to 12px, reduced compiler-col and memory-col min/max widths by ~10%
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Table styling is in Metrics/index.css, not inline in HTMLGenerator.ts
  - The CSS file is linked via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./Metrics/index.css">` in the generated report

## 2026-01-10 - US-001
- What was implemented: Removed expand chevron from language cells for cleaner interface
- Files changed:
  - Metrics/HTMLGenerator.ts: Removed `<span class="expand-chevron">›</span>` from language cell
  - Metrics/index.css: Removed .expand-chevron CSS styles
  - Metrics/report_client.js: Removed expand-chevron click handler
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The expand functionality is now gone - language cells only open the modal on click
  - The pre-existing ScreenshotUtils.ts typecheck error is unrelated to code changes
