## Codebase Patterns
- Use `check_toolchain <toolname>` in compile() to gracefully report env_error when toolchain missing
- runMe.sh scripts should source ../common.sh and define LANGUAGE, SOLVER_BINARY, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS
- README.md should document package requirements with apt install commands
- Test with matrix 1 first (656 iterations is the expected count)

## 2026-01-09 06:50 - US-001
- Verified Ada implementation was already properly configured
- gnatmake exists in Docker at /usr/bin/gnatmake
- runMe.sh already has proper structure: LANGUAGE, SOLVER_BINARY, METRICS_FILE, TIMEOUT_SECONDS
- check_toolchain gnatmake already in compile() function
- README.md already documents gnat requirement (apt install gnat)
- Tested: ./runMe.sh ../../Matrices/1.matrix - produces 656 iterations (correct)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Ada was already properly configured, so no code changes needed
  - Some languages may already be fixed - verify before making changes
