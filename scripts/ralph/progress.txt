Thread: (Current Session)
- Implemented LanguageMeta interface in Metrics/LanguagesMetadata.ts
- Populated paradigm and typeSystem for C, Rust, Java, Python, JavaScript
- Verified type safety with tsc
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Metrics/LanguagesMetadata.ts is the single source of truth for language display data.
  - The project uses TypeScript for the Metrics subsystem, verify changes with `cd Metrics && npx tsc --noEmit`.

Thread: (Current Session)
- Added 'Historical Context' section to langModal in Metrics/HTMLGenerator.ts.
- Added 'Technical Specs' row for Paradigm and Type System in langModal.
- Added edit inputs for history, paradigm, and typeSystem in the modal.
- Verified that typecheck still passes.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HTMLGenerator.ts uses a massive template literal for the report HTML.
  - The modal has two modes: `view-only` and `edit-only` classes controlled by CSS/JS.

Thread: (Current Session)
- Updated `window.showLanguageDetails` in `Metrics/report_client.js` to populate:
  - `modalParadigm` and `modalTypeSystem`
  - `modalHistory` (with display logic to hide container if empty)
  - Edit inputs for the new fields.
- Updated `window.saveLanguageDetails` to include `history`, `paradigm`, and `typeSystem` in the POST payload.
- Verified type safety (tsc passes, though report_client.js is JS, the project structure seems to treat it as part of the build).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `report_client.js` is a large client-side script embedded by `HTMLGenerator.ts`.
  - It handles the UI logic for the report.
  - Changes here need to match the HTML structure defined in `HTMLGenerator.ts`.

Thread: (Current Session)
- Implemented Asset Health Dashboard in `Metrics/HTMLGenerator.ts`.
- Logic compares `orderedLanguages` with `logoMap` to identify missing assets.
- Added a visual section at the bottom of the report showing the count and names of languages missing logos.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `orderedLanguages` must be imported and exported in `HTMLGenerator.ts` to be used for global asset health checks.
  - `logoMap` keys are normalized (lowercase, special chars handled) to match filesystem names.
