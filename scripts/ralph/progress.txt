- Deleted `Metrics/generate_report_simple.js` and `Metrics/generate_report_only.js`.
- Removed fallback logic in `server/index.js` that tried to use the simple generator.
- Fixed `Metrics/tsconfig.json` to include "DOM" lib, resolving a pre-existing type error in `ScreenshotUtils.ts`.
- Created `Metrics/AGENTS.md` to document the tsconfig requirement.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `server/index.js` contained a fallback mechanism that hid failures in the primary TypeScript generator.
  - `Metrics` project has a `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` that need to be maintained.
