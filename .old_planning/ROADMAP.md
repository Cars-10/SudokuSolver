# Roadmap: Sudoku Solver Enhancements

## Overview

Multi-algorithm Sudoku benchmark suite demonstrating performance trade-offs across different solving approaches. The core brute-force benchmark remains the "Red Pill" baseline, while advanced algorithms (DLX, CP) are housed in separate directory structures for clean comparison.
