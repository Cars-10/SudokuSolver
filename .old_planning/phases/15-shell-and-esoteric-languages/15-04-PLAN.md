<objective>
Evaluate feasibility and document scope for remaining shell languages and esoteric languages

Purpose: Based on patterns established in Plans 01-03 (BASH, PowerShell, AWK), determine which remaining languages warrant DLX/CP implementations and document infeasibility rationale for languages that cannot support these algorithms. This prevents wasted effort on languages with fundamental constraints that make advanced algorithms impractical.
Output: Feasibility assessment document and scope decision for remaining Phase 15 languages.

**From Plans 01-03:**
- BASH: [Success/Partial/Infeasible - determined from 15-01-SUMMARY]
- PowerShell: [Success/Partial/Infeasible - determined from 15-02-SUMMARY]
- AWK: [Success/Partial/Infeasible - determined from 15-03-SUMMARY]

**Remaining Languages:**
- **Shell Languages**: Dash, Fish, Ksh, Tcsh, Zsh
- **Esoteric/Limited Languages**: Brainfuck, M4, Make, Sed

**Known Constraints:**
- Brainfuck: Hardcoded solution (see README.md), no runtime data structures, Turing-complete but impractical
- M4: Macro processor, limited arithmetic, no arrays
- Make: Build tool, not a general programming language, very limited data structures
- Sed: Stream editor, pattern-based, no data structures for algorithm state

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Evaluate remaining shell languages feasibility</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/15-shell-and-esoteric-languages/FEASIBILITY.md</files>
  <action>
Analyze each remaining shell language's capabilities for DLX/CP implementation and create feasibility assessment.

**Languages to Evaluate:**
1. **Dash** (Debian Almquist Shell) - POSIX-compliant, minimal shell
2. **Fish** (Friendly Interactive Shell) - Modern shell with arrays and functions
3. **Ksh** (KornShell) - POSIX + extensions, associative arrays (ksh93+)
4. **Tcsh** (TENEX C Shell) - C shell with enhancements, arrays available
5. **Zsh** (Z Shell) - Feature-rich, associative arrays, arithmetic

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Array support (indexed and/or associative)
- Arithmetic operations (esp. bitwise for CP)
- Function/subroutine capabilities
- Recursion support (for backtracking)
- Comparison to BASH capabilities

**Decision Framework:**
- **FEASIBLE**: Has arrays, arithmetic, functions, recursion → Create implementation plans (15-05, 15-06, etc.)
- **PARTIAL**: Limited capabilities but possible with workarounds → Create with caveats
- **INFEASIBLE**: Lacks fundamental requirements → Document why, skip implementation

# Phase 15: Language Feasibility Assessment

## Summary
Based on implementations in BASH, PowerShell, and AWK, we established that DLX/CP require:
- [List specific requirements from 15-01/02/03]

## Shell Languages

### Dash (POSIX Shell)
- **Arrays**: [Indexed only / None / Associative available]
- **Bitwise Ops**: [Available / Not available / Workaround possible]
- **Recursion**: [Supported / Limited / Not supported]
- **Decision**: [FEASIBLE / PARTIAL / INFEASIBLE]
- **Rationale**: [1-2 sentences]

### Fish
[Same structure]

### Ksh
[Same structure]

### Tcsh
[Same structure]

### Zsh
[Same structure]

## Esoteric/Limited Languages

### Brainfuck
- **Decision**: INFEASIBLE
- **Rationale**: No runtime data structures. Existing BruteForce implementation uses hardcoded solution. DLX (130 LOC C, circular linked lists) and CP (361 LOC C, bitset operations) would require thousands of Brainfuck instructions and hours of runtime. Already documented in BruteForce/Brainfuck/README.md.

### M4 (Macro Processor)
- **Arrays**: None (text substitution only)
- **Arithmetic**: Limited (define-based)
- **Decision**: INFEASIBLE
- **Rationale**: M4 is a text macro processor, not a programming language. No arrays, no recursion with state, no way to maintain algorithm data structures.

### Make (Build Tool)
- **Decision**: INFEASIBLE
- **Rationale**: Make is a build dependency tool, not a general programming language. No arrays, no functions, targets and prerequisites are not suitable for algorithm state management.

### Sed (Stream Editor)
- **Decision**: INFEASIBLE
- **Rationale**: Sed processes text streams line-by-line with pattern matching. No arrays, no function calls, hold space is insufficient for 81-cell grid + algorithm state. While Turing-complete, implementing DLX/CP would be completely impractical.

## Recommendations

### Implement (Create plans 15-05+):
[List FEASIBLE languages]

### Document and Skip:
[List INFEASIBLE languages]

The esoteric languages (Brainfuck, M4, Make, Sed) are fundamentally unsuited for DLX and CP algorithms. Their BruteForce implementations already represent the maximum practical complexity for their respective paradigms.

  <action>
Based on FEASIBILITY.md evaluation, create implementation plans for languages marked FEASIBLE.

**Plan Structure:**
- If 1-2 languages feasible: Create single plan (15-05) with both languages
- If 3-4 languages feasible: Create 2 plans (15-05, 15-06) with 2 languages each
- If 5+ languages feasible: Create 3+ plans with 2 languages per plan

**Each plan should:**
- Follow the pattern from 15-01/02/03 (2 tasks: DLX + CP for each language)
- Reference FEASIBILITY.md in context
- Include language-specific implementation notes
- Set depends_on: ["15-04"] for first new plan, chain subsequent plans

**If no languages are feasible:**
- Update this task's done criteria to reflect "No additional plans needed"
- Document in 15-04-SUMMARY that Phase 15 is complete with 3 shell implementations

**Example plan naming:**
- 15-05-PLAN.md: Dash + Fish (if both feasible)
- 15-06-PLAN.md: Ksh + Tcsh (if both feasible)
- etc.

  </action>
  <verify>

Check that plans exist for all feasible languages identified in FEASIBILITY.md.

- Implementation plans created for all feasible languages
- Plans follow established patterns from 15-01/02/03
- Plan dependencies properly set (15-04 → 15-05 → 15-06, etc.)
- Or: No additional plans needed if no languages feasible
  </done>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] FEASIBILITY.md exists with all 9 languages evaluated
- [ ] Each language has clear FEASIBLE/PARTIAL/INFEASIBLE decision
- [ ] Rationale provided for infeasible languages
- [ ] Follow-up plans created for feasible languages (or documented as "none needed")
- [ ] Esoteric languages (Brainfuck, M4, Make, Sed) documented as infeasible with rationale

<success_criteria>

- Both tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- Clear decision framework for remaining Phase 15 languages
- Either: Follow-up plans (15-05+) ready for execution, OR: Phase 15 complete with 3 implementations
- Esoteric languages documented as out of scope for DLX/CP with clear rationale

# Phase 15 Plan 4: Language Feasibility Assessment Summary

**Evaluated 9 remaining languages and established scope for Phase 15 completion**

## Accomplishments

- Comprehensive feasibility analysis for 5 shell languages (Dash, Fish, Ksh, Tcsh, Zsh)
- Documented infeasibility for 4 esoteric/limited languages (Brainfuck, M4, Make, Sed)
- Created follow-up implementation plans for feasible languages (if any)
- Established clear rationale for out-of-scope languages

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/15-shell-and-esoteric-languages/FEASIBILITY.md` - Comprehensive language capability analysis
- `.planning/phases/15-shell-and-esoteric-languages/15-05-PLAN.md` (if applicable)
- `.planning/phases/15-shell-and-esoteric-languages/15-06-PLAN.md` (if applicable)

## Decisions Made

1. **Esoteric Languages Scope**: Brainfuck, M4, Make, and Sed are fundamentally unsuited for DLX/CP algorithms due to lack of data structures, arrays, or practical implementation paths. Their BruteForce implementations represent maximum practical complexity.

2. **Shell Language Criteria**: Based on BASH/PowerShell/AWK implementations, feasibility requires: [list specific criteria from analysis]

3. **Follow-up Plans**: [Created N plans for M feasible languages / No additional implementations needed]

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

[If follow-up plans created]: Ready for Plan 15-05 (next shell language implementations)
[If no follow-up plans]: Phase 15 complete. Ready for Phase 16: Specialized Languages - Part 1
