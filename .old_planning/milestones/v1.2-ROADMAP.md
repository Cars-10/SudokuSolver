# Milestone v1.2: Interactive Reporting

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-13
**Phases:** 4-6
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Enhanced the HTML reporting UI with interactive algorithm selection, comprehensive performance visualizations, and multi-algorithm support. This milestone transformed the static benchmark report into an interactive exploration tool enabling users to filter and compare BruteForce, DLX, and CP algorithms through six D3.js-powered charts.

## Phases

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Fixes

**Goal**: Update all BruteForce runMe.sh scripts for new directory structure and fix modal paths
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (v1.1 complete)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 04-01: Update BruteForce runMe.sh header comments (completed 2026-01-13)

**Details:**

Updated all 63 BruteForce runMe.sh scripts to reflect the new `Algorithms/BruteForce/` directory structure established in Phase 2.1 (v1.1). This was a mechanical cleanup ensuring consistency across all three algorithm types (BruteForce, DLX, CP).

**Performance**: 1 minute execution via sed batch update.

**Key artifacts:**
- Verified all three algorithm types functional with spot tests
- Confirmed iteration counts match baselines (C: 656, DLX: 43, CP: 67 on Matrix 1)

### Phase 5: Algorithm Selector UI

**Goal**: Build interactive UI controls for algorithm filtering and selection
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 05-01: Algorithm selector dropdown with filtering (completed 2026-01-13)

**Details:**

Extended metrics loading to scan `Algorithms/BruteForce/`, `Algorithms/DLX/`, and `Algorithms/CP/` directories (84 total entries). Added dropdown button UI with neon styling matching existing controls. Implemented client-side filtering for instant algorithm switching without page reload.

**Key features:**
- Multi-algorithm metrics loading from all three directories
- Dropdown selector with algorithm filtering (BruteForce, DLX, CP, All)
- Algorithm-specific C baselines for accurate per-algorithm comparisons
- Visual badges (DLX=blue, CP=purple) for identification in "All Algorithms" view
- Ran complete C baselines for DLX and CP across all 6 matrices

**Performance**: 28 minutes execution including baseline benchmarks.

**Key decisions:**
- Client-side filtering approach for instant switching (better UX than regenerating reports)
- Algorithm-specific C baselines to prevent false mismatches (BF→C BF, DLX→C DLX, CP→C CP)
- Visual badges for algorithm identification when viewing all algorithms together

### Phase 6: Core Performance Charts

**Goal**: Implement essential performance comparison visualizations (algorithm comparison, language performance, iteration counts)
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 06-01: Algorithm & Language Comparison Charts (completed 2026-01-13)
- [x] 06-02: Iteration Analysis & Integration (completed 2026-01-13)

**Details:**

**Plan 06-01 (15 min):** Created two core D3.js charts:
1. **Algorithm Comparison Chart** - Grouped bar visualization comparing BruteForce, DLX, CP across time, iterations, and efficiency metrics using log scale for order-of-magnitude differences
2. **Top Languages Chart** - Horizontal bar chart ranking implementations with C baseline reference line and delta percentages, color gradient (green=fast, red=slow)

**Plan 06-02 (48 min):** Added iteration count visualization and polished production readiness:
1. **Iterations Chart** - Top 10 languages by iteration count with algorithm filtering
2. **Bug fixes** - Resolved 6 critical issues discovered during integration testing:
   - Algorithm-specific baseline selection (critical: DLX now compares to C DLX, not C BF)
   - Chart resize in fullscreen mode
   - Algorithm badge positioning and overlap fixes
   - Label clarity with algorithm suffixes (e.g., "C (BF)", "C (DLX)")
   - BF tagging for visual consistency across all algorithms
3. **Chart transitions** - 200ms fade timing for smooth switching

**Performance**: 63 minutes total (15 min + 48 min).

**Key decisions:**
- Log scale for Algorithm Comparison chart to handle order-of-magnitude iteration differences
- Horizontal layout for Top Languages to accommodate variable-length language names
- Top 10/15 limits for chart readability (88+ languages would create scroll overload)
- 200ms fade transition balances responsiveness with smoothness
- Algorithm-aware rankings using algorithm-specific C baselines

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

None - milestone executed sequentially through Phases 4-6.

**Key Decisions:**

- **Client-side Filtering**: JavaScript-based algorithm switching for instant response without page reload
- **Algorithm-Specific Baselines**: Each algorithm type compares against its own C reference (not BruteForce baseline)
- **Visual Algorithm Badges**: All algorithms tagged (BF=green, DLX=blue, CP=purple) in All Algorithms view
- **Chart Transition Timing**: 200ms fade balances responsiveness with smoothness
- **Iteration Chart Language Limit**: Top 10 languages prevents overcrowding while showing key performers
- **Algorithm-Aware Rankings**: Languages compare to their own algorithm's C baseline for fair comparison

**Issues Resolved:**

- Algorithm baseline mismatch: Fixed all charts to use algorithm-specific C references
- Chart resize bugs: Fullscreen mode now properly resizes in both directions
- Label clarity: Added algorithm suffixes to distinguish multiple C variants
- Badge positioning: Fixed overlap issues, badges now left-aligned to tick marks
- Metrics merging: Fixed overwriting bug where only one C variant appeared (now 84 entries)
- Visual consistency: BruteForce implementations now tagged with "BF" like other algorithms

**Issues Deferred:**

None - all discovered issues resolved during milestone execution.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None significant - production-ready implementation with comprehensive testing.

## Visualization Suite

The complete 6-chart suite provides comprehensive performance analysis:

1. **Algorithm Comparison** - Cross-algorithm efficiency comparison (time, iterations, efficiency)
2. **Top Languages** - Performance ranking within algorithm types with C baseline
3. **Iterations Chart** - Top performers by iteration count
4. **Memory Distribution** - Memory usage patterns (existing chart)
5. **Execution Time** - Runtime performance (existing chart)
6. **Language Details Modal** - Deep-dive into individual implementations (existing feature)

**User Workflow:**
- Select algorithm type (BruteForce/DLX/CP/All) via dropdown
- Charts instantly filter to show algorithm-specific data
- Switch between 6 visualization types via chart selector
- Drill down into individual languages via modal
