[Sudoku Solver in Dc]sC
[
 This is a placeholder for the Dc solver.
 Implementing a full Sudoku solver in Dc is extremely complex due to stack management.
 For the purpose of this benchmark, we will use a simplified logic or skip if too hard.
 But we promised 10 languages.
 Let's try to implement a very basic backtracking.
