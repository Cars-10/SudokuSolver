```bash
cat .planning/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No brief found"

**If no brief exists:**
Ask: "No brief found. Want to create one first, or proceed with roadmap?"

If proceeding without brief, gather quick context:

- What are we building?
- What's the rough scope?
</step>


<step name="detect_domain">
Scan for available domain expertise:

```bash
ls ./.claude/skills/expertise/ 2>/dev/null
```

**Inference:** Based on the brief/user request, infer applicable domains:

| Keywords                                 | Domain                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| "macOS", "Mac app", "menu bar", "AppKit" | expertise/macos-apps     |
| "iPhone", "iOS", "iPad", "mobile app"    | expertise/iphone-apps    |
| "Unity", "game", "C#", "3D game"         | expertise/unity-games    |
| "MIDI", "sequencer", "music app"         | expertise/midi           |
| "ISF", "shader", "GLSL", "visual effect" | expertise/isf-shaders    |
| "UI", "design", "frontend", "Tailwind"   | expertise/ui-design      |
| "Agent SDK", "Claude SDK", "agentic"     | expertise/with-agent-sdk |

**If domain inferred:**

```
Detected: [domain] project → expertise/[name]
Include this domain expertise? (Y / see options / none)
```

**If multiple domains apply** (e.g., ISF shaders for a macOS app):

```
Detected multiple domains:
- expertise/isf-shaders (shader development)
- expertise/macos-apps (native app)

Include both? (Y / select one / none)
```

**If no domain obvious:**

```
Available domain expertise:
1. macos-apps
2. iphone-apps
[... others found ...]

N. None - proceed without domain expertise

Select (comma-separate for multiple):
```

**Store selected paths** for inclusion in ROADMAP.md.

<step name="identify_phases">
Derive phases from the actual work needed.

**Check depth setting:**
```bash
cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep depth
```

<depth_guidance>
**Depth controls compression tolerance, not artificial inflation.**

| Depth | Typical Phases | Typical Plans/Phase | Tasks/Plan |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Quick | 3-5 | 1-3 | 2-3 |
| Standard | 5-8 | 3-5 | 2-3 |
| Comprehensive | 8-12 | 5-10 | 2-3 |

**Key principle:** Derive phases from actual work. Depth determines how aggressively you combine things, not a target to hit.

- Comprehensive auth system = 8 phases (because auth genuinely has 8 concerns)
- Comprehensive "add favicon" = 1 phase (because that's all it is)

For comprehensive depth:
- Don't compress multiple features into single phases
- Each major capability gets its own phase
- Let small things stay small—don't pad to hit a number
- If you're tempted to combine two things, make them separate phases instead

For quick depth:
- Combine related work aggressively
- Focus on critical path only
- Defer nice-to-haves to future milestones
</depth_guidance>

**Phase Numbering System:**

Use integer phases (1, 2, 3) for planned milestone work.

Use decimal phases (2.1, 2.2) for urgent insertions:

- Decimal phases inserted between integers (2.1 between 2 and 3)
- Mark with "(INSERTED)" in phase title
- Created when urgent work discovered after planning
- Examples: bugfixes, hotfixes, critical patches

**When to use decimals:**

- Urgent work that can't wait for next milestone
- Critical bugs blocking progress
- Security patches needing immediate attention
- NOT for scope creep or "nice to haves" (those go in ISSUES.md)

**Phase execution order:**
Numeric sort: 1 → 1.1 → 1.2 → 2 → 2.1 → 3

**Deriving phases:**

1. List all distinct systems/features/capabilities required
2. Group related work into coherent deliverables
3. Each phase should deliver ONE complete, verifiable thing
4. If a phase delivers multiple unrelated capabilities: split it
5. If a phase can't stand alone as a complete deliverable: merge it
6. Order by dependencies

Good phases are:

- **Coherent**: Each delivers one complete, verifiable capability
- **Sequential**: Later phases build on earlier
- **Independent**: Can be verified and committed on its own

Common phase patterns:

- Foundation → Core Feature → Enhancement → Polish
- Setup → MVP → Iteration → Launch
- Infrastructure → Backend → Frontend → Integration
  </step>

<step name="detect_research_needs">
**For each phase, determine if research is likely needed.**

Scan the brief and phase descriptions for research triggers:

<research_triggers>
**Likely (flag the phase):**

| Trigger Pattern                                       | Why Research Needed                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "integrate [service]", "connect to [API]"             | External API - need current docs        |
| "authentication", "auth", "login", "JWT"              | Architectural decision + library choice |
| "payment", "billing", "Stripe", "subscription"        | External API + compliance patterns      |
| "email", "SMS", "notifications", "SendGrid", "Twilio" | External service integration            |
| "database", "Postgres", "MongoDB", "Supabase"         | If new to project - setup patterns      |
| "real-time", "websocket", "sync", "live updates"      | Architectural decision                  |
| "deploy", "Vercel", "Railway", "hosting"              | If first deployment - config patterns   |
| "choose between", "select", "evaluate", "which"       | Explicit decision needed                |
| "AI", "OpenAI", "Claude", "LLM", "embeddings"         | Fast-moving APIs - need current docs    |
| Any technology not already in codebase                | New integration                         |
| Explicit questions in brief                           | Unknowns flagged by user                |

**Unlikely (no flag needed):**

| Pattern                                     | Why No Research         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| "add button", "create form", "update UI"    | Internal patterns       |
| "CRUD operations", "list/detail views"      | Standard patterns       |
| "refactor", "reorganize", "clean up"        | Internal work           |
| "following existing patterns"               | Conventions established |
| Technology already in package.json/codebase | Patterns exist          |

</research_triggers>

**For each phase, assign:**

- `Research: Likely ([reason])` + `Research topics: [what to investigate]`
- `Research: Unlikely ([reason])`

**Important:** These are hints, not mandates. The mandatory_discovery step during phase planning will validate.

Present research assessment:

```
Research needs detected:

Phase 1: Foundation
  Research: Unlikely (project setup, established patterns)

Phase 2: Authentication
  Research: Likely (new system, technology choice)
  Topics: JWT library for [stack], session strategy, auth provider options

Phase 3: Stripe Integration
  Research: Likely (external API)
  Topics: Current Stripe API, webhook patterns, checkout flow

Phase 4: Dashboard
  Research: Unlikely (internal UI using patterns from earlier phases)

Does this look right? (yes / adjust)

Use template from `./.claude/get-shit-done/templates/roadmap.md`.

Initial roadmaps use integer phases (1, 2, 3...).
Decimal phases added later via /gsd:insert-phase command (if it exists).

Write to `.planning/ROADMAP.md` with:

- Domain Expertise section (paths from detect_domain step, or "None" if skipped)
- Phase list with names and one-line descriptions
- Dependencies (what must complete before what)
- **Research flags** (from detect_research_needs step):
  - `Research: Likely ([reason])` with `Research topics:` for flagged phases
  - `Research: Unlikely ([reason])` for unflagged phases
- Status tracking (all start as "not started")

<anti_patterns>
- Don't add time estimates
- Don't create Gantt charts
- Don't add resource allocation
- Don't include risk matrices
- Don't impose arbitrary phase counts (let the work determine the count)

Phases are buckets of work, not project management artifacts.
