# Milestone Context Template

Template for `.planning/MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md` - temporary handoff file from discuss-milestone to create-milestone.

**Purpose:** Persist milestone discussion context so `/clear` can be used between commands. This file is consumed by `/gsd:new-milestone` and deleted after the milestone is created.

*This file is temporary. It will be deleted after /gsd:new-milestone creates the milestone.*
```

<guidelines>
**This is a handoff artifact, not permanent documentation.**

The file exists only to pass context from `discuss-milestone` to `create-milestone` across a `/clear` boundary.

**Lifecycle:**
1. `/gsd:discuss-milestone` creates this file at end of discussion
2. User runs `/clear` (safe now - context is persisted)
3. `/gsd:new-milestone` reads this file
4. `/gsd:new-milestone` uses context to populate milestone
5. `/gsd:new-milestone` deletes this file after successful creation

**Content should include:**
- Features identified (the core of what to build)
- Suggested milestone name/theme
- Rough phase mapping
- Any constraints or scope boundaries
- Notes from discussion

**Content should NOT include:**
- Technical analysis (that comes during phase research)
- Detailed phase specifications (create-milestone handles that)
- Implementation details
</guidelines>
