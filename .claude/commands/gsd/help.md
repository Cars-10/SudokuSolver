# GSD Command Reference

**GSD** (Get Shit Done) creates hierarchical project plans optimized for solo agentic development with Claude Code.

## Quick Start

1. `/gsd:new-project` - Initialize project with brief
2. `/gsd:create-roadmap` - Create roadmap and phases
3. `/gsd:plan-phase <number>` - Create detailed plan for first phase
4. `/gsd:execute-plan <path>` - Execute the plan

## Core Workflow

```
Initialization → Planning → Execution → Milestone Completion
```

### Project Initialization

**`/gsd:new-project`**
Initialize new project with brief and configuration.

- Creates `.planning/PROJECT.md` (vision and requirements)
- Creates `.planning/config.json` (workflow mode)
- Asks for workflow mode (interactive/yolo) upfront
- Commits initialization files to git

Usage: `/gsd:new-project`

**`/gsd:create-roadmap`**
Create roadmap and state tracking for initialized project.

- Creates `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (phase breakdown)
- Creates `.planning/STATE.md` (project memory)
- Creates `.planning/phases/` directories

Usage: `/gsd:create-roadmap`

**`/gsd:map-codebase`**
Map an existing codebase for brownfield projects.

- Analyzes codebase with parallel Explore agents
- Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 focused documents
- Covers stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns
- Use before `/gsd:new-project` on existing codebases

Usage: `/gsd:map-codebase`

### Phase Planning

**`/gsd:discuss-phase <number>`**
Help articulate your vision for a phase before planning.

- Captures how you imagine this phase working
- Creates CONTEXT.md with your vision, essentials, and boundaries
- Use when you have ideas about how something should look/feel

Usage: `/gsd:discuss-phase 2`

**`/gsd:research-phase <number>`**
Comprehensive ecosystem research for niche/complex domains.

- Discovers standard stack, architecture patterns, pitfalls
- Creates RESEARCH.md with "how experts build this" knowledge
- Use for 3D, games, audio, shaders, ML, and other specialized domains
- Goes beyond "which library" to ecosystem knowledge

Usage: `/gsd:research-phase 3`

**`/gsd:list-phase-assumptions <number>`**
See what Claude is planning to do before it starts.

- Shows Claude's intended approach for a phase
- Lets you course-correct if Claude misunderstood your vision
- No files created - conversational output only

Usage: `/gsd:list-phase-assumptions 3`

**`/gsd:plan-phase <number>`**
Create detailed execution plan for a specific phase.

- Generates `.planning/phases/XX-phase-name/XX-YY-PLAN.md`
- Breaks phase into concrete, actionable tasks
- Includes verification criteria and success measures
- Multiple plans per phase supported (XX-01, XX-02, etc.)

Usage: `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
Result: Creates `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

### Execution

**`/gsd:execute-plan <path>`**
Execute a PLAN.md file directly.

- Runs plan tasks sequentially
- Creates SUMMARY.md after completion
- Updates STATE.md with accumulated context
- Fast execution without loading full skill context

Usage: `/gsd:execute-plan .planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

### Roadmap Management

**`/gsd:add-phase <description>`**
Add new phase to end of current milestone.

- Appends to ROADMAP.md
- Uses next sequential number
- Updates phase directory structure

Usage: `/gsd:add-phase "Add admin dashboard"`

**`/gsd:insert-phase <after> <description>`**
Insert urgent work as decimal phase between existing phases.

- Creates intermediate phase (e.g., 7.1 between 7 and 8)
- Useful for discovered work that must happen mid-milestone
- Maintains phase ordering

Usage: `/gsd:insert-phase 7 "Fix critical auth bug"`
Result: Creates Phase 7.1

### Milestone Management

**`/gsd:discuss-milestone`**
Figure out what you want to build in the next milestone.

- Reviews what shipped in previous milestone
- Helps you identify features to add, improve, or fix
- Routes to /gsd:new-milestone when ready

Usage: `/gsd:discuss-milestone`

**`/gsd:new-milestone <name>`**
Create a new milestone with phases for an existing project.

- Adds milestone section to ROADMAP.md
- Creates phase directories
- Updates STATE.md for new milestone

Usage: `/gsd:new-milestone "v2.0 Features"`

**`/gsd:complete-milestone <version>`**
Archive completed milestone and prepare for next version.

- Creates MILESTONES.md entry with stats
- Archives full details to milestones/ directory
- Creates git tag for the release
- Prepares workspace for next version

Usage: `/gsd:complete-milestone 1.0.0`

### Progress Tracking

**`/gsd:progress`**
Check project status and intelligently route to next action.

- Shows visual progress bar and completion percentage
- Summarizes recent work from SUMMARY files
- Displays current position and what's next
- Lists key decisions and open issues
- Offers to execute next plan or create it if missing
- Detects 100% milestone completion

Usage: `/gsd:progress`

### Session Management

**`/gsd:resume-work`**
Resume work from previous session with full context restoration.

- Reads STATE.md for project context
- Shows current position and recent progress
- Offers next actions based on project state

Usage: `/gsd:resume-work`

**`/gsd:pause-work`**
Create context handoff when pausing work mid-phase.

- Creates .continue-here file with current state
- Updates STATE.md session continuity section
- Captures in-progress work context

Usage: `/gsd:pause-work`

### Issue Management

**`/gsd:consider-issues`**
Review deferred issues with codebase context.

- Analyzes all open issues against current codebase state
- Identifies resolved issues (can close)
- Identifies urgent issues (should address now)
- Identifies natural fits for upcoming phases
- Offers batch actions (close, insert phase, note for planning)

Usage: `/gsd:consider-issues`

## Workflow Modes

Set during `/gsd:new-project`:

**Interactive Mode**

- Confirms each major decision
- Pauses at checkpoints for approval
- More guidance throughout

**YOLO Mode**

- Auto-approves most decisions
- Executes plans without confirmation
- Only stops for critical checkpoints

Change anytime by editing `.planning/config.json`

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**

```
/gsd:new-project
/gsd:create-roadmap
/gsd:plan-phase 1
/gsd:execute-plan .planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md
```

**Resuming work after a break:**

```
/gsd:progress  # See where you left off and continue
```

**Adding urgent mid-milestone work:**

```
/gsd:insert-phase 5 "Critical security fix"
/gsd:plan-phase 5.1
/gsd:execute-plan .planning/phases/05.1-critical-security-fix/05.1-01-PLAN.md
```

**Completing a milestone:**

```
/gsd:complete-milestone 1.0.0
/gsd:new-project  # Start next milestone
```

## Getting Help

- Read `.planning/PROJECT.md` for project vision
- Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current context
- Check `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase status
- Run `/gsd:progress` to check where you're up to
