description: Gather phase context through adaptive questioning before planning
argument-hint: "[phase]"

<objective>
Help the user articulate their vision for a phase through collaborative thinking.

Purpose: Understand HOW the user imagines this phase working — what it looks like, what's essential, what's out of scope. You're a thinking partner helping them crystallize their vision, not an interviewer gathering technical requirements.

Output: {phase}-CONTEXT.md capturing the user's vision for the phase
</objective>

<execution_context>
@./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase.md
@./.claude/get-shit-done/templates/context.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

**Load project state first:**
@.planning/STATE.md

**Load roadmap:**
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
</context>

<process>
1. Validate phase number argument (error if missing or invalid)
2. Check if phase exists in roadmap
3. Check if CONTEXT.md already exists (offer to update if yes)
4. Follow discuss-phase.md workflow with **ALL questions using AskUserQuestion**:
   - Present phase from roadmap
   - Use AskUserQuestion: "How do you imagine this working?" with interpretation options
   - Use AskUserQuestion to follow their thread — probe what excites them
   - Use AskUserQuestion to sharpen the core — what's essential for THIS phase
   - Use AskUserQuestion to find boundaries — what's explicitly out of scope
   - Use AskUserQuestion for decision gate (ready / ask more / let me add context)
   - Create CONTEXT.md capturing their vision
5. Offer next steps (research or plan the phase)

**CRITICAL: ALL questions use AskUserQuestion. Never ask inline text questions.**

User is the visionary, you are the builder:
- Ask about vision, feel, essential outcomes
- DON'T ask about technical risks (you figure those out)
- DON'T ask about codebase patterns (you read the code)
- DON'T ask about success metrics (too corporate)
- DON'T interrogate about constraints they didn't mention
</process>

<success_criteria>

- Phase validated against roadmap
- Vision gathered through collaborative thinking (not interrogation)
- CONTEXT.md captures: how it works, what's essential, what's out of scope
- User knows next steps (research or plan the phase)
</success_criteria>
