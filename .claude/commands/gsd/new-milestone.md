description: Create a new milestone with phases for an existing project

<objective>
Create a new milestone for an existing project with defined phases.

Purpose: After completing a milestone (or when ready to define next chunk of work), creates the milestone structure in ROADMAP.md with phases, updates STATE.md, and creates phase directories.
Output: New milestone in ROADMAP.md, updated STATE.md, phase directories created
</objective>

<execution_context>
@./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/create-milestone.md
@./.claude/get-shit-done/templates/roadmap.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Milestone name: $ARGUMENTS (optional - will prompt if not provided)

**Load project state first:**
@.planning/STATE.md

**Load roadmap:**
@.planning/ROADMAP.md

**Load milestones (if exists):**
@.planning/MILESTONES.md
</context>

<process>
1. Load project context (STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, MILESTONES.md)
2. Calculate next milestone version and starting phase number
3. If milestone name provided in arguments, use it; otherwise prompt
4. Gather phases (per depth setting: quick 3-5, standard 5-8, comprehensive 8-12):
   - If called from /gsd:discuss-milestone, use provided context
   - Otherwise, prompt for phase breakdown
5. Detect research needs for each phase
6. Confirm phases (respect config.json gate settings)
7. Follow create-milestone.md workflow:
   - Update ROADMAP.md with new milestone section
   - Create phase directories
   - Update STATE.md for new milestone
   - Git commit milestone creation
8. Offer next steps (discuss first phase, plan first phase, review)
</process>

<success_criteria>

- Next phase number calculated correctly (continues from previous milestone)
- Phases defined per depth setting (quick: 3-5, standard: 5-8, comprehensive: 8-12)
- Research flags assigned for each phase
- ROADMAP.md updated with new milestone section
- Phase directories created
- STATE.md reset for new milestone
- Git commit made
- User knows next steps
