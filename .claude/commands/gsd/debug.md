<objective>
Debug issues using scientific method with a persistent debug document that survives `/clear`.

If resuming (no arguments and active session exists): pick up where you left off.
If starting new: gather symptoms, then investigate autonomously.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/debug.md
@./.claude/get-shit-done/templates/DEBUG.md
</execution_context>

<context>
User's issue: $ARGUMENTS

Check for active debug sessions:
```bash
ls .planning/debug/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5
```
</context>

<process>
Follow the workflow in @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/debug.md

**Quick reference:**

1. **Check for active sessions** - Offer to resume or start new
2. **Gather symptoms** - What happened? What should happen? Errors? When?
3. **Create DEBUG.md** - Document symptoms in `.planning/debug/[slug].md`
4. **Investigate** - Evidence → Hypothesis → Test → Eliminate or Confirm
5. **Fix and verify** - Minimal fix, verify against original symptoms
6. **Archive** - Move to `.planning/debug/resolved/`

**Key principle:** The DEBUG.md is your memory. Update it constantly. It survives `/clear`.
