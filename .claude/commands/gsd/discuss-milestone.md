description: Gather context for next milestone through adaptive questioning

<objective>
Help you figure out what to build in the next milestone through collaborative thinking.

Purpose: After completing a milestone, explore what features you want to add, improve, or fix. Features first — scope and phases derive from what you want to build.
Output: Context gathered, then routes to /gsd:new-milestone
</objective>

<execution_context>

</execution_context>

<context>
**Load project state first:**
@.planning/STATE.md

**Load roadmap:**
@.planning/ROADMAP.md

**Load milestones (if exists):**
@.planning/MILESTONES.md
</context>

<process>
1. Verify previous milestone complete (or acknowledge active milestone)
2. Present context from previous milestone (accomplishments, phase count)
3. Follow discuss-milestone.md workflow with **ALL questions using AskUserQuestion**:
   - Use AskUserQuestion: "What do you want to add, improve, or fix?" with feature categories
   - Use AskUserQuestion to dig into features they mention
   - Use AskUserQuestion to help them articulate what matters most
   - Use AskUserQuestion for decision gate (ready / ask more / let me add context)
4. Hand off to /gsd:new-milestone with gathered context

**CRITICAL: ALL questions use AskUserQuestion. Never ask inline text questions.**
</process>
