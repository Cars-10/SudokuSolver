<objective>
Display changes between installed version and latest available version.

Shows version comparison, changelog entries for missed versions, and update instructions.
</objective>

<process>

<step name="get_installed_version">
Read installed version from VERSION file:

```bash
cat ./.claude/get-shit-done/VERSION 2>/dev/null
```

**If VERSION file missing:**
```
## GSD What's New

**Installed version:** Unknown

Your installation doesn't include version tracking.

**To fix:** `npx get-shit-done-cc --global`

This will reinstall with version tracking enabled.
```

STOP here if no VERSION file.
</step>

<step name="fetch_remote_changelog">
Fetch latest CHANGELOG.md from GitHub:

Use WebFetch tool with:
- URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done/main/CHANGELOG.md`
- Prompt: "Extract all version entries with their dates and changes. Return in Keep-a-Changelog format."

**If fetch fails:**
Fall back to local changelog:
```bash
cat ./.claude/get-shit-done/CHANGELOG.md 2>/dev/null
```

Note to user: "Couldn't check for updates (offline or GitHub unavailable). Showing local changelog."
</step>

<step name="parse_versions">
From the remote (or local) changelog:

1. **Extract latest version** - First `## [X.Y.Z]` line after `## [Unreleased]`
2. **Compare with installed** - From VERSION file
3. **Extract entries between** - All version sections from latest down to (but not including) installed

**Version comparison:**
- If installed == latest: "You're on the latest version"
- If installed < latest: Show changes since installed version
- If installed > latest: "You're ahead of latest release (development version?)"
</step>

<step name="display_output">
Format output clearly:

**If up to date:**
```
