# Integrations

## Internal
- **Docker:** The project uses a custom Docker image (`sudoku-benchmark`) to normalize toolchains across environments.
- **Filesystem:** Heavy reliance on filesystem for state passing (JSON files, logs).

## External
- None. The project is designed to be air-gapped/offline capable.
