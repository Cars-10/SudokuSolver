# Roadmap: Sudoku Solver Enhancements

## Overview

Multi-algorithm Sudoku benchmark suite demonstrating performance trade-offs across different solving approaches. The core brute-force benchmark remains the "Red Pill" baseline, while advanced algorithms (DLX, CP) are housed in separate directory structures for clean comparison.

## Domain Expertise

None

## Completed Milestones

- ✅ [v1.1 Algorithmic Expansion](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md) (Phases 1-3) — SHIPPED 2026-01-13

## Current Milestone

**Status:** Planning next milestone

No active milestone. Ready to define v1.2 or v2.0 scope.

## All Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.
