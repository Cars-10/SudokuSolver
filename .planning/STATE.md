# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-25)

**Core value:** Providing a fair, transparent, and visually engaging comparison of programming language performance using a standardized algorithmic implementation.

**Current focus:** Planning next milestone or project wrap-up

## Current Position

Milestone: v3.0 Quality & Insights — ✅ COMPLETE
Status: Ready for next milestone
Last activity: 2026-01-25 — v3.0 milestone complete and archived

Progress: v3.0 shipped (4 phases, 11 plans, 23 requirements)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 14 (v1.0: 4, v3.0: 10)
- Average duration: ~5.5 days per plan (v1.0 avg), 3.3 minutes (v3.0 avg)
- Total execution time: ~33 days (v1.0), 32.7 minutes (v3.0)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Scoring Engine | 1 | ~10 days | ~10 days |
| 2. UI/UX Refine | 2 | ~15 days | ~7.5 days |
| 3. Metadata Align | 1 | ~8 days | ~8 days |
| 4. Validation Infra | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |
| 5. Scoring Analysis | 2 | 9 min | 4.5 min |
| 6. Visualization & UI | 4 | 15.4 min | 3.9 min |
| 7. Interactive Solver | 4 | 12.3 min | 3.1 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- v1.0 completed in 33 days (manual exploration)
- v2.0 completed in 1 day (retroactive metadata work)
- v3.0 Phase 4 completed in 2 minutes (autonomous execution)
- v3.0 Phase 5 completed in 9 minutes (autonomous execution, 2 plans)
- v3.0 Phase 6 completed in 15.4 minutes (4 plans: 06-01 UI fixes, 06-02 advanced viz, 06-03 validation UI, 06-04 chart validation)
- v3.0 Phase 7 completed in 12.3 minutes (4 plans: 07-01 solver engine, 07-02 visual rendering, 07-03 animation controls, 07-04 integration & UI)
- Trend: Sustained velocity with autonomous execution - averaging 3.3 minutes per plan across Phase 4-7

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All major decisions are now logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v3.0 milestone decisions archived to milestones/v3.0-ROADMAP.md.

### Pending Todos

None - v3.0 milestone complete.

### Blockers/Concerns

**v3.0 Completed:**
- ✅ All 4 phases delivered (Validation, Scoring Analysis, Visualization & UI, Interactive Solver)
- ✅ 23 of 28 requirements shipped (82% complete)
- ✅ 5 requirements deferred to future (VIZ-04, VIZ-05, VIZ-06, UI-04, advanced features)
- ✅ Milestone archived to milestones/v3.0-ROADMAP.md and milestones/v3.0-REQUIREMENTS.md

**Known issues for future:**
- Data integrity: One metric file has undefined solver (handled defensively)
- Deferred visualizations: Iteration delta chart, validation dashboard, sensitivity chart

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-25
Stopped at: v3.0 milestone completion and archival
Resume file: None

**Next steps:**
1. ✅ v3.0 milestone complete - 4 phases, 11 plans, 23 requirements shipped
2. ✅ Milestone archived to milestones/v3.0-ROADMAP.md and milestones/v3.0-REQUIREMENTS.md
3. ✅ PROJECT.md evolved with validated requirements
4. Start next milestone with `/gsd:new-milestone` (requires fresh requirements definition)
5. Or: Project wrap-up, additional features, or polish work
