# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-13)

**Core value:** "If it runs, we should see how it runs." — rigorous, visible benchmarking.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Algorithm - Dancing Links

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 3 (Algorithm - Dancing Links)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Complete
Last activity: 2026-01-13 — Completed phase-2-plan-2-implementation (DLX Algorithm)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 2 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: ~8 min
- Total execution time: 0.65 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | 15m | 15m |
| 2 | 3 | 24m | 8m |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: [Phase 1 Metadata, Phase 2 Scaffolding, Phase 2.1 Refactor, Phase 2 Implementation]
- Trend: Accelerating - Phase 2 avg 8 min/plan (down from Phase 1's 15 min)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Algorithm Separation - Maintain "Red Pill" purity by keeping new algos in `Algorithms/[Type]/`.
- [Init]: Metadata constraints - Keep descriptions < 50 chars.
- [Phase 1]: Metadata Schema - Standardized on `paradigm`, `typeSystem`, and concise `history`. Long history moved to `description`.
- [Phase 2]: DLX Structure - `Algorithms/DLX/C` established for C implementation of Algorithm X.
- [Phase 2.1]: Unified Directory Structure - All brute-force solvers in `Algorithms/BruteForce/`, common.sh at `Algorithms/` level, runMeGlobal supports algorithm parameter.
