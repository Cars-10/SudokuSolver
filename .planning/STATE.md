# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-13)

**Core value:** "If it runs, we should see how it runs." — rigorous, visible benchmarking.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone (v1.2 or v2.0)

## Current Position

Phase: None (milestone v1.1 complete)
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan next milestone
Last activity: 2026-01-13 — v1.1 milestone complete

Progress: [          ] 0% (No active milestone)

## Performance Metrics (v1.1)

- Milestone duration: 1.5 hours (start to ship)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | 15m | 15m |
| 2 | 3 | 24m | 8m |
| 3 | 2 | 16m | 8m |

**Milestone Stats:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

Most recent milestone decisions (v1.1):
- Unified Directory Structure - All algorithms under `Algorithms/[Type]/` pattern
- DLX Memory Strategy - Pre-allocated node pool for performance
- CP Candidate Tracking - Bitset representation with macro helpers
- Iteration Counting Consistency - Each algorithm counts comparable operations

### Deferred Issues

None.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. All v1.1 work complete and shipped.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-13
Stopped at: Completed v1.1 milestone archival
Resume file: None
Next step: Define v1.2/v2.0 scope via `/gsd:discuss-milestone` or `/gsd:new-milestone`
