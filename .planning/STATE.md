# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** A polyglot benchmarking project comparing 80+ programming languages on an identical brute-force Sudoku solving task with strict algorithmic consistency.

**Core requirements:**
- Matrix 1 rule (656 iterations) strictly enforced across all Tier 1 languages
- 100% functional Content Server UI for editing language metadata
- Reproducible Docker environment for all 80+ languages
- Single-file benchmark_report.html remains high-performance and visually stunning

**Constraints:**
- Algorithmic Consistency: Every implementation must use the exact same recursive backtracking algorithm
- "Red Pill" Aesthetic: High-contrast, Neon dark mode is the standard for all UI/Reports
- Darwin Primary: Development focus on macOS/Darwin, with Docker for Linux/CI parity
