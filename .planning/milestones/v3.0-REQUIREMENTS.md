## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones.

### Advanced Features

- **ADV-01**: Historical trend lines integration with HistoryManager.ts
- **ADV-02**: Interactive filtering by language attributes (paradigm, typing, etc.)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded to maintain focus and prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Custom weight configuration UI | Prevents stable cross-run comparisons unless locked after selection |
| Real-time benchmark execution in browser | Security/resource concerns, defeats purpose of pre-run benchmarks |
| User-submitted benchmark results | Data integrity and verification challenges |
| Mobile/responsive design overhaul | Desktop-first focus, defer to v4+ |
| Docker/remote execution enhancements | Local execution focus per PROJECT.md decisions |
