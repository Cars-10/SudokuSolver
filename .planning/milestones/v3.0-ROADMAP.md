# Milestone v3.0: Quality & Insights

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-25
**Phases:** 4-7
**Total Plans:** 11

## Overview

Ensure algorithmic correctness through enhanced validation, determine optimal scoring methodology through data analysis, and provide richer insights through improved visualizations and interactive features.

**Milestone Goal:** Quality assurance through validation infrastructure, statistical rigor through scoring analysis, and enhanced user experience through advanced visualizations and interactive solver.

## Phases

### Phase 4: Validation Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish credibility foundation through algorithmic correctness validation at benchmark execution time, ensuring iteration counts match C reference and solutions satisfy Sudoku constraints, with fail-fast error handling and benchmark_issues.json logging.

**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase of v3.0)

**Requirements:** VAL-01, VAL-02, VAL-03, VAL-06

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Add validation functions to common.sh and integrate into run_matrix()

**Details:**

This phase adds validation logic to the benchmark execution pipeline (common.sh) with transparent integration into all language implementations via run_matrix().

**Key components:**
1. Validation functions in common.sh - detect_algorithm_type, get_reference_iterations, validate_iteration_count, validate_solution, write_validation_failure
2. Integration in run_matrix() - Validation executes after output extraction, before metrics write
3. Fail-fast behavior - Validation failure exits immediately with error code 1
4. Logging to benchmark_issues.json - All validation failures logged with timestamp, severity, details

**Success Criteria:**
1. common.sh validates iteration count against C reference (656 for matrix 1) with exact match for BruteForce, +/-1 for DLX/CP
2. common.sh validates solution correctness (9x9 Sudoku constraints satisfied) during benchmark execution
3. Validation failure stops benchmark immediately (fail-fast) and logs to benchmark_issues.json
4. C reference implementation passes all validation (it defines correctness)
5. No changes required to any runMe.sh scripts (transparent integration)

**Completed:** 2026-01-23

### Phase 5: Scoring Analysis

**Goal:** Provide statistical rigor through sensitivity analysis, correlation computation, and versioned scoring to validate current methodology and enable informed future improvements.

**Depends on:** Phase 4 (needs validated data for accurate scoring analysis)

**Requirements:** SCORE-01, SCORE-02, SCORE-03, SCORE-04, SCORE-05, SCORE-06, SCORE-07

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Create scoring analysis module with sensitivity, correlation, and outlier functions
- [x] 05-02: Integrate analysis into HTMLGenerator.ts with interactive UI components

**Details:**

This phase creates a scoring analysis module (Metrics/scoring-analysis.ts) with statistical functions, then integrates them into HTMLGenerator.ts with interactive UI elements including stacked bar score decomposition, expandable sensitivity rows, and summary insight cards.

**Key components:**
1. Analysis Module (scoring-analysis.ts) - calculateSensitivityScores, calculateRankStability, computeCorrelation, identifyOutliers, calculatePercentiles
2. UI Integration (HTMLGenerator.ts) - Score decomposition stacked bars, expandable sensitivity rows, Scoring Insights summary section
3. Dependency - simple-statistics library for statistical calculations (correlation, quartiles, IQR)

**Success Criteria:**
1. System performs sensitivity analysis across weight scenarios (time-only, 80/20, 50/50, memory-only)
2. Report shows score decomposition view (time 80% + memory 20% contributions visible)
3. System calculates rank stability per language across weight scenarios
4. Report displays correlation analysis (R^2 for time vs memory relationship)
5. System identifies and flags statistical outliers with analysis
6. Scoring methodology changes preserve historical comparability through versioning

**Completed:** 2026-01-23

### Phase 6: Visualization & UI

**Goal:** Reveal performance patterns through advanced chart types while fixing UI bugs to provide polished, insightful visual experience.

**Depends on:** Phase 4 + Phase 5 (visualizes validation results and scoring insights)

**Requirements:** VAL-04, VAL-05, VIZ-01, VIZ-02, VIZ-03, UI-01, UI-02, UI-03

**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Fix UI bugs: algorithm dropdown sorting and Matrix Race fullscreen exit
- [x] 06-02: Add advanced visualizations: scatter plot, heatmap, histogram
- [x] 06-03: Add validation UI: warning badges and diagnostics modal
- [x] 06-04: Wire validation styling to scatter plot and heatmap charts (gap closure)

**Details:**

This phase fixes UI bugs (dropdown sorting, fullscreen exit), adds three advanced D3.js visualizations (scatter plot, heatmap, histogram), and surfaces validation results through warning badges and diagnostics modal.

**Key components:**
1. UI Bug Fixes (06-01) - Algorithm dropdown alphabetical sorting, Matrix Race fullscreen exit loop fix
2. Advanced Visualizations (06-02) - Time vs Memory scatter plot with log scale, Language x Matrix heatmap with click-to-detail, Score distribution histogram with percentile markers
3. Validation UI (06-03) - Warning badges on invalid implementations, diagnostics modal showing iteration mismatch details
4. Gap Closure (06-04) - Wire validation styling to scatter plot and heatmap charts

**Success Criteria:**
1. Report includes scatter plot showing Time vs Memory with logarithmic scales
2. Report includes heatmap showing Language x Matrix performance patterns
3. Report includes distribution histogram showing score clusters/tiers
4. Algorithm dropdown sorts options alphabetically and updates labels correctly
5. Matrix Race fullscreen exit works correctly without temporary exit/re-enter bug
6. All visualizations handle 70+ languages and 6 orders of magnitude without misleading scales
7. Report displays visual warning badges for invalid implementations (VAL-04)
8. Diagnostics modal shows iteration mismatch details (VAL-05)
9. Invalid implementations visually distinguished in scatter plot and heatmap charts

**Completed:** 2026-01-24

### Phase 7: Interactive Solver

**Goal:** Provide engaging, visually entertaining solver animation with Neon/Matrix theme styling for interactive user exploration.

**Depends on:** Phase 6 (UI foundation and visualization patterns established)

**Requirements:** INT-01, INT-02, INT-03, INT-04, INT-05

**Key components:**
1. Solver Engine (07-01) - Browser-compatible BruteForce solver with state emission, immutable state history with 10K limit
2. Visual Layer (07-02) - 3D CSS grid with neon glow, spin animations, glitch effects (screen shake, alien scramble)
3. Animation + Controls (07-03) - requestAnimationFrame loop with speed control (1x-100x), playback controls UI

## Milestone Summary

**Requirements shipped:** 23 of 28 v3.0 requirements (82% complete)

**Deferred to future:**
- VIZ-04: Iteration delta chart for validation diagnostics
- VIZ-05: Validation dashboard visualization
- VIZ-06: Scoring sensitivity chart with interactive weight exploration
- UI-04: Visual layout issues resolved
- Advanced features: Algorithmic fingerprinting, Zen Mode, A/B testing framework

**Key Decisions:**

- Execution-time Validation: Validate during benchmark execution for immediate feedback, preventing invalid metrics from being written (Phase 4)
- Algorithm-specific Tolerance: BruteForce requires exact iteration match; DLX/CP allow +/-1 tolerance (Phase 4)
- IQR Outlier Detection: Use IQR method over Z-score for robustness to skewed distributions (Phase 5)
- R² Interpretation Thresholds: Very strong ≥0.8, moderate ≥0.5, weak ≥0.3 for accessibility (Phase 5)
- Stacked Bar Visualization: 80% blue (time) + 20% orange (memory) inline stacked bars make 80/20 weighting transparent (Phase 5)
- Logarithmic Scale by Default: Scatter plot and heatmap use log scale to handle 6 orders of magnitude (Phase 6)
- Interactive Solver Modal: Launch from INFO dropdown as modal popup for better focus and immersive experience (Phase 7)
- Delta-time Animation: requestAnimationFrame with delta-time calculation prevents animation speed doubling on high-refresh displays (Phase 7)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Matrix Race fullscreen exit/re-enter loop fixed with surgical guard
- Algorithm dropdown now sorts alphabetically for predictable UX
- TypeScript compilation issues resolved with proper import paths and Map iteration compatibility
- Interactive solver memory management with 10K state history limit

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Data integrity issue: One metric file has undefined solver (handled defensively in 3 locations)
- Some deferred visualization requirements (VIZ-04, VIZ-05, VIZ-06) could enhance validation diagnostics
