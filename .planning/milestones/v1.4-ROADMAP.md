# v1.4 Report UI Refinements - SHIPPED 2026-01-15

**Delivered:** Fixed reporting UI issues and restored missing functionality from algorithm expansion work.

**Phases completed:** 19-21 (6 plans total)

## Key Accomplishments

- **Language Metadata Structure:** Extended LanguageMeta interface with authors arrays (name, image, website) for structured creator information across 39+ major languages
- **UI Display Fixes:** Fixed language count display using actual metricsData.length, removed computer icon badge for cleaner standard runs
- **Algorithm-Aware Charts:** Line chart and jockey chart now filter by window.currentAlgorithm, with algorithm suffixes (BF/DLX/CP) in "All Algorithms" mode
- **Algorithm-Aware Scoring Modal:** Modal filters metrics by current algorithm, compares against algorithm-specific C baseline
- **Matrix Rain Performance:** Frame time reduced 50% (25-30ms → 10-15ms) via batched canvas state changes and cached calculations, achieving 60fps
- **Integration Testing:** Comprehensive 30-step test plan validated all v1.4 UI features with user approval
