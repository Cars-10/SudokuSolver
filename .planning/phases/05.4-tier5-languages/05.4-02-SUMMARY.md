# Phase 05.4-tier5-languages - Plan 02 - SUMMARY

## Objective
Implement Red and Wren Sudoku solvers with exact algorithm match and C reference output format.

## Status
- Wren: **COMPLETE** (Passed all 5 matrices with exact iteration counts)
- Red: **DEFERRED** (Toolchain requires 32-bit i386 libraries unavailable on ARM64 Ubuntu 24.04)

## Activities
- **Dockerfile Update**: Attempted to add Red toolchain; confirmed it fails on ARM64 due to 404 on `ports.ubuntu.com` for `i386` architecture packages. Reverted Red to deferred status but kept the toolchain logic documented.
- **Wren Implementation**:
  - Developed `Sudoku.wren` using the class-based Wren language.
  - Matched C algorithm exactly (incrementing counter before validity check).
  - Matched C output format exactly (including triple puzzle printout and specific headers).
  - Created `runMe.sh` and `README.md`.
- **Validation**:
  - Wren successfully passed all 5 reference matrices:
    - Matrix 1: 656 iterations
    - Matrix 2: 439,269 iterations
    - Matrix 3: 98,847 iterations
    - Matrix 4: 9,085 iterations
    - Matrix 5: 445,778 iterations
- **Metadata & Reporting**:
  - Added Wren and Red to `Metrics/LanguagesMetadata.ts` (ordered list, histories, quotes, and metadata).
  - Regenerated the benchmark report (`_report.html`) within the Docker container.
- **State Management**:
  - Updated `STATE.md` to reflect 48 validated languages and 3 deferred in Tier 5.

## Results
- **Wren**: Excellent performance for a scripting language (~0.9ms for Matrix 1, ~6ms for Matrix 5).
- **Red**: Deferred until native ARM64 or 64-bit Linux support is available from the language authors.

## Next Steps
Proceed to Plan 03 (Janet and Pike implementation).
