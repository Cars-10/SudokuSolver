# Phase 05.4-tier5-languages - Plan 03 - SUMMARY

## Objective
Implement Janet and Pike Sudoku solvers with exact algorithm match and C reference output format.

## Status
- Janet: **COMPLETE** (Passed all 5 matrices with exact iteration counts)
- Pike: **COMPLETE** (Passed all 5 matrices with exact iteration counts)

## Activities
- **Dockerfile Update**: Added Janet (build from source) and Pike (apt package) toolchains.
- **Janet Implementation**:
  - Developed `Sudoku.janet` matching C algorithm and output format.
  - Created `runMe.sh` and `README.md`.
  - Debugged and fixed several parsing and logic errors (parenthesis matching, `do` block structure, anonymous function syntax).
- **Pike Implementation**:
  - Developed `Sudoku.pike` matching C algorithm and output format.
  - Created `runMe.sh` and `README.md`.
  - Debugged and fixed time measurement function (`gethrtime`).
- **Validation**:
  - Janet successfully passed all 5 reference matrices:
    - Matrix 1: 656 iterations
    - Matrix 2: 439,269 iterations
    - Matrix 3: 98,847 iterations
    - Matrix 4: 9,085 iterations
    - Matrix 5: 445,778 iterations
  - Pike successfully passed all 5 reference matrices:
    - Matrix 1: 656 iterations
    - Matrix 2: 439,269 iterations
    - Matrix 3: 98,847 iterations
    - Matrix 4: 9,085 iterations
    - Matrix 5: 445,778 iterations
- **Metadata & Reporting**:
  - Added Janet and Pike to `Metrics/LanguagesMetadata.ts` (ordered list, histories, quotes, and metadata).
  - Regenerated the benchmark report (`_report.html`) within the Docker container.
- **State Management**:
  - Updated `STATE.md` to reflect 50 validated languages and 3 deferred in Tier 5.

## Results
- **Janet**: Solver successfully implemented and validated.
- **Pike**: Solver successfully implemented and validated.

## Next Steps
Proceed to the next plan in Phase 05.4.
