# Phase 5.4 Plan 01: Io & Factor Summary

**Both Io and Factor DEFERRED - ARM64 platform limitations prevent implementation on this architecture**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 54 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-19T00:38:58Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-19T01:32:42Z
- **Tasks:** 4 (evaluation complete, implementation deferred)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Evaluated Io toolchain - discovered ARM64 coroutine assembly issues (`coro_arm64_getcontext` undefined)
- Evaluated Factor toolchain - discovered x86_64-only pre-built binaries
- Updated Dockerfile with deferred status documentation for both languages
- Rebuilt Docker image successfully (no functional changes, documentation only)

## Files Created/Modified

- `server/Dockerfile` - Added Tier 5 section with Io and Factor marked as DEFERRED

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Defer Io | ARM64 coroutine library has undefined symbols (`coro_arm64_getcontext`, `coro_arm64_setcontext`) - upstream fix required |
| Defer Factor | Only x86_64 pre-built binaries available from factorcode.org, no ARM64 support |

## Deviations from Plan

### Platform Limitations

**1. [Blocking] Io ARM64 coroutine issues**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Docker build)
- **Issue:** Io language's coroutine library uses ARM64 assembly that isn't properly linked
- **Error:** `undefined reference to 'coro_arm64_getcontext'` and `coro_arm64_setcontext`
- **Resolution:** Marked as DEFERRED - requires upstream Io language fix
- **Impact:** Cannot implement Io solver on ARM64 machines

**2. [Blocking] Factor x86_64-only**
- **Found during:** Task 3 (Docker build evaluation)
- **Issue:** Factor language only publishes x86_64 Linux binaries
- **Resolution:** Marked as DEFERRED - requires ARM64 binaries from Factor project
- **Impact:** Cannot implement Factor solver on ARM64 machines

## Issues Encountered

Both target languages have ARM64 architecture limitations that prevent implementation. This is consistent with other deferred languages in the project (Swift, Smalltalk, Forth) which also have platform-specific issues.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 05.4-02 (Red, Wren) should be evaluated next for ARM64 compatibility
- Consider researching ARM64 support for remaining Tier 5 languages before attempting
- Languages that compile to existing runtimes (e.g., Fennel compiles to Lua) may have better ARM64 support
