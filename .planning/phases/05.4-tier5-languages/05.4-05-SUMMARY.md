# Phase 05.4-tier5-languages - Plan 05 - SUMMARY

## Objective
Integrate and validate existing Assembly and EmacsLisp Sudoku solvers.

## Status
- Assembly: **DEFERRED** (Architecture mismatch: x86-64 assembly in an ARM64 Docker environment)
- EmacsLisp: **COMPLETE** (Passed all 5 matrices with exact iteration counts)

## Activities
- **Dockerfile Update**: Added `nasm` (for Assembly) and `emacs-nox` (for EmacsLisp) toolchains.
- **Assembly Implementation Attempt**:
  - Corrected macOS-specific syntax in `Sudoku.asm` to be Linux-compatible.
  - Attempted to compile and link, but encountered "file in wrong format" errors.
  - Determined the cause to be an architecture mismatch between the x86-64 assembly code and the ARM64 Docker environment.
  - Deferred Assembly implementation due to the complexity of setting up a cross-compilation environment.
- **EmacsLisp Implementation**:
  - Created a `runMe.sh` script to correctly execute the `sudoku.el` solver.
  - Debugged and fixed several issues in `sudoku.el`, including command-line argument handling, recursion logic, and output formatting.
- **Validation**:
  - EmacsLisp successfully passed all 5 reference matrices:
    - Matrix 1: 656 iterations
    - Matrix 2: 439,269 iterations
    - Matrix 3: 98,847 iterations
    - Matrix 4: 9,085 iterations
    - Matrix 5: 445,778 iterations
- **Metadata & Reporting**:
  - Regenerated the benchmark report (`_report.html`) to include EmacsLisp.
- **State Management**:
  - Updated `STATE.md` to reflect the completion of EmacsLisp and the deferral of Assembly.

## Results
- **Assembly**: Deferred.
- **EmacsLisp**: Solver successfully implemented and validated.

## Next Steps
Phase 5.4 is now complete, with all planned languages either validated or explicitly deferred.
