# Phase 2.2 Plan 01: Fix Screenshot Automation Summary

**Removed fullPage option from Puppeteer screenshot - now captures 1920x1080 viewport instead of 13353-pixel full page**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-18T11:04:49Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-18T11:05:33Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Removed `fullPage: true` from screenshot call in ScreenshotUtils.ts
- Verified TypeScript runs without errors
- Confirmed screenshot dimensions: 1920x1080 (down from 1920x13353)
- File size reduced from ~1.8MB to ~137KB per screenshot

## Files Created/Modified
- `Metrics/ScreenshotUtils.ts` - Removed fullPage option from page.screenshot() call on line 38

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
- TypeScript compiler check showed errors in node_modules type definitions (minimatch/glob types), but these are unrelated to our code change. The actual script runs successfully.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Screenshot automation working correctly
- Ready for Phase 3 (Scripting Languages)
