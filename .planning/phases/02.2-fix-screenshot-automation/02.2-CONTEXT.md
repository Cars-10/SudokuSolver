# Phase 2.2: Fix Screenshot Automation - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Screenshots should automatically capture just the Chart and Top 5 languages by score section after every report generation. The current implementation creates screenshots but they don't render properly (don't look like the actual web page) and are way too large (8000+ pixels).

The fix should produce a clean, properly-rendered 1920x1080 screenshot that shows exactly what you'd see in a browser — the performance chart and the top 5 scoring languages, framed consistently every time.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Consistent framing** - Every screenshot captures the same elements (chart + top 5) in the same position, every time
- **Proper dimensions** - 1920x1080, not 8000+ pixels
- **Correct rendering** - Screenshot looks like the actual browser view, not a broken/partial render

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Full-page screenshots - Don't need ability to capture the entire scrollable page
- Multiple image formats - PNG only, no JPEG/WebP options needed
- Screenshot comparison/diffing - Not detecting visual changes between runs

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Target content: Chart + Top 5 languages by score table only
- Resolution: Standard desktop 1920x1080
- The current screenshot is creating but rendering incorrectly and oversized

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The screenshot automation exists but produces broken output. This is a fix to make existing functionality work correctly, not building new features.
