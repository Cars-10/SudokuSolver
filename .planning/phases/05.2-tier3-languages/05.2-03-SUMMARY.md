# Phase 5.2 Plan 03: Erlang and Scheme Summary

**Erlang escript solver with process dictionary state, Scheme (Guile) solver with mutable vectors - both passing all 5 matrices**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-18T17:45:00Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-18T17:53:17Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 4 (2 READMEs created, 2 existing solvers validated)

## Accomplishments

- Validated Erlang solver passing all 5 matrices with exact iteration counts
- Validated Scheme (Guile) solver passing all 5 matrices with exact iteration counts
- Created README.md documentation for both languages
- Verified runMe.sh scripts follow common.sh pattern
- Both metrics.json files populated with benchmark data

## Files Created/Modified

- `Languages/Erlang/README.md` - Implementation notes and validation status
- `Languages/Scheme/README.md` - Implementation notes and validation status
- `Languages/Erlang/sudoku.erl` - Pre-existing, validated (process dictionary for state)
- `Languages/Scheme/sudoku.scm` - Pre-existing, validated (mutable vectors for grid)

## Validation Results

### Erlang

| Matrix | Expected | Actual  | Status |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1      | 656      | 656     | PASS   |
| 2      | 439,269  | 439,269 | PASS   |
| 3      | 98,847   | 98,847  | PASS   |
| 4      | 9,085    | 9,085   | PASS   |
| 5      | 445,778  | 445,778 | PASS   |

### Scheme (Guile)

| Matrix | Expected | Actual  | Status |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1      | 656      | 656     | PASS   |
| 2      | 439,269  | 439,269 | PASS   |
| 3      | 98,847   | 98,847  | PASS   |
| 4      | 9,085    | 9,085   | PASS   |
| 5      | 445,778  | 445,778 | PASS   |

## Decisions Made

None - followed plan as specified. Both implementations were pre-existing and only needed validation and documentation.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Both solvers were already implemented correctly.

## Issues Encountered

None - both implementations passed validation on first attempt.

## Implementation Notes

### Erlang
- Uses process dictionary (`put/get`) for mutable state
- Counter stored as `put(count, N)` - incremented on each value attempt
- Puzzle cells stored as `put({puzzle, Row, Col}, Value)`
- Interpreted via escript (no compilation)

### Scheme
- Uses global `define` with `set!` for mutable counter
- Puzzle stored as flat vector: `(make-vector 81 0)`
- Named let for iteration patterns
- Interpreted via GNU Guile

## Next Phase Readiness

- 32/40 Tier 3 languages complete (Awk, Tcl, Pascal, Prolog, Erlang, Scheme)
- Ready for 05.2-04-PLAN.md (Common Lisp + Clojure)
