# Phase 5.2 Plan 5: Zig and COBOL Summary

**Zig solver validated with exact iteration counts; COBOL solver has unresolved performance issues causing timeouts**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 29 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-18T18:14:21Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-18T18:43:18Z
- **Tasks:** 4 (2 complete, 2 partial)
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Zig solver algorithm corrected (iteration counting moved inside for loop)
- Zig validated on all 5 matrices with exact iteration counts (656, 439269, 98847, 9085, 445778)
- Zig runMe.sh and README.md created
- COBOL solver implemented with iterative backtracking algorithm
- COBOL compiles successfully with GnuCOBOL 3.1.2.0

## Files Created/Modified

- `Languages/Zig/Sudoku.zig` - Fixed iteration counting location
- `Languages/Zig/runMe.sh` - Benchmark runner script
- `Languages/Zig/README.md` - Documentation with validation status
- `Languages/Cobol/sudoku.cob` - Iterative backtracking solver
- `Languages/Cobol/runMe.sh` - Benchmark runner script
- `Languages/Cobol/README.md` - Documentation noting incomplete status

## Decisions Made

- Zig: Moved iteration counter from start of solve() into the for loop to match C reference algorithm
- COBOL: Used iterative approach with pre-computed empty cells list instead of recursion

## Deviations from Plan

### Issues Encountered

**COBOL Performance Problem:**
- **Found during:** Task 3-4 (COBOL implementation and validation)
- **Issue:** COBOL solver works correctly on simple puzzles (< 10 empty cells) but times out on complex puzzles (Matrix 1 with 45 empty cells)
- **Investigation:**
  - Tried recursive approach with nested CALL
  - Tried iterative approach with explicit stack
  - Tried pre-computed empty cells list
  - All approaches timeout after 2+ minutes
- **Status:** Unresolved - marked as incomplete
- **Hypothesis:** GnuCOBOL's interpreted comparison operations may have significant per-operation overhead that compounds with millions of validity checks

## Issues Encountered

- COBOL solver has correct algorithm but unacceptable performance
- Multiple implementation strategies tested, all with same timeout result
- Zig fixed and working without issues

## Next Phase Readiness

- **Zig:** Complete and validated (39 languages total)
- **COBOL:** Incomplete due to performance issues
- **Tier 3 overall:** 9/10 languages validated
- Ready for phase completion if COBOL issue is deferred
