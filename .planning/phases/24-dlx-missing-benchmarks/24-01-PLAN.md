<objective>
Validate BASH and Erlang DLX benchmarks and regenerate the HTML report.

Purpose: Ensure the HTML report includes the recently-completed BASH and Erlang DLX benchmarks with correct data.
Output: Updated _report.html with all 47 DLX implementations including BASH and Erlang showing correct iteration counts (43 for Matrix 1).

Reference iteration counts (from C reference):
- DLX Matrix 1: 43 iterations
- DLX Matrix 2: 111 iterations
- DLX Matrix 3: 131 iterations
- DLX Matrix 4: 70 iterations
- DLX Matrix 5: 1472 iterations
</context>

<current_state>
Based on metrics analysis (2026-01-15):

**BASH DLX**: ✅ WORKING
- metrics.json shows iterations=43 for Matrix 1
- Time: 205ms
- Produces correct solution

**Erlang DLX**: ✅ WORKING
- metrics.json shows iterations=43 for Matrix 1
- Time: 490ms
- All matrices complete with correct iteration counts: 43, 111, 131, 70, 1472

Both implementations are now working correctly. The original v1.3 validation report marked them as "missing data" but benchmarks have since been run successfully.

**Report Status:**
- _report.html last modified: 2026-01-15 10:26
- Contains BASH references (7 occurrences - likely BruteForce)
- Needs verification that DLX data for BASH and Erlang is included
</current_state>

  <name>Task 1: Validate BASH and Erlang DLX Metrics</name>
  <files>Algorithms/DLX/BASH/metrics.json, Algorithms/DLX/Erlang/metrics.json</files>
  <action>
  Confirm both metrics files contain correct data:

  1. BASH DLX:
     - Check metrics.json has Matrix 1 result with iterations=43
     - Verify status="success"
     - Note execution time for report comparison

  2. Erlang DLX:
     - Check metrics.json has Matrix 1 result with iterations=43
     - Verify status="success"
     - Note execution time for report comparison

  Both should already be correct from Phase 22 timeframe execution.

  <name>Task 2: Regenerate HTML Report</name>
  <files>_report.html, Metrics/gather_metrics.ts, Metrics/HTMLGenerator.ts</files>
  <action>
  Regenerate the HTML report to ensure BASH and Erlang DLX data is included:

  1. Run the report generation script:
     ```bash
     cd Metrics && npx ts-node generate_report_only.ts
     ```

  2. The script will:
     - Scan Algorithms/DLX/ for all metrics.json files
     - Include BASH and Erlang DLX data
     - Generate updated _report.html

  Note: If generate_report_only.ts fails, try:
     ```bash
     ./runReport.sh
     ```
  </action>
  <verify>ls -la _report.html shows updated timestamp; grep for "BASH" and "Erlang" in DLX context</verify>
  <done>Report regenerated with latest metrics data</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Validate Report Contains BASH and Erlang DLX</name>
  <files>_report.html</files>
  <action>
  Verify the regenerated report includes BASH and Erlang DLX data:

  1. Search for BASH DLX entry:
     - Should show "BASH" with algorithm "DLX"
     - Iterations should be 43 for Matrix 1

  2. Search for Erlang DLX entry:
     - Should show "Erlang" with algorithm "DLX"
     - Iterations should be 43 for Matrix 1

  3. Count total DLX implementations:
     - Should be 47 languages
     - BASH and Erlang should now appear (previously "missing data")

  Use grep to verify:
  ```bash
  grep -o '"solver":"BASH"' _report.html | head -5
  grep -o '"solver":"Erlang"' _report.html | head -5
  ```
  </action>
  <verify>Report contains BASH and Erlang entries with DLX algorithm and correct iteration counts</verify>
  <done>Report validated with BASH and Erlang DLX showing 43 iterations for Matrix 1</done>
</task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] BASH DLX metrics.json shows iterations=43 for Matrix 1
- [ ] Erlang DLX metrics.json shows iterations=43 for Matrix 1
- [ ] _report.html regenerated with current timestamp
- [ ] Report includes BASH DLX data with correct values
- [ ] Report includes Erlang DLX data with correct values
- [ ] Total DLX implementations count is correct (47)
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All verification checks pass
- BASH and Erlang DLX appear in the HTML report
- Both show correct iteration counts (43 for Matrix 1)
- Report generation completes without errors
</success_criteria>
