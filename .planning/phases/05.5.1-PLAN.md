# Phase 5.5.1: Modals

## Goal
Fix and enhance modal interactions (dragging, editing, layout) for the Language Detail modal.

## Objectives
1.  **Refine Modal Dragging:** Ensure dragging is smooth and constrained to viewport.
2.  **Fix Content Layout:** Ensure long content (descriptions, authors) doesn't break the layout.
3.  **Enhance Edit Mode:** Improve the UX for editing metadata (save feedback, validation).
4.  **Z-Index & Stacking:** Ensure modals always appear on top of other elements (like the chart).

## Plan Breakdown
1.  Review `Metrics/report_client.js` modal logic.
2.  Review `Metrics/index.css` modal styles.
3.  Implement fixes/enhancements.
4.  Verify with a mock interactions.

## Success Criteria
- Modal draggable without glitches.
- Edit/Save works reliably.
- Modal looks good on all screen sizes.
