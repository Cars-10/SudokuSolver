# Phase 5.5: Final UI Enhancements - Plan 02

## Objective
Integrate the history display natively into the dashboard and improve visual consistency.

## Tasks
1.  **Create Native History View:**
    *   Add a new container for the native history table in `Metrics/HTMLGenerator.ts`.
    *   Update `switchChart` in `Metrics/report_client.js` to render history data directly into `d3-chart-container` instead of using an iframe.
    *   Style the history table to match the neon aesthetic (scrolling, colors, fonts).

2.  **Refine Dashboard Top Bar:**
    *   Improve button styling and alignment in the `controls` section.
    *   Ensure the `personality-selector` and other dropdowns have a consistent "Red Pill" look.

3.  **Final CSS Polish:**
    *   Add smooth transitions for all interactive elements.
    *   Enhance "neon glow" effects on key UI components.

## Deliverables
- Integrated, native history view.
- Polished and consistent top-bar controls.
- Enhanced visual aesthetic across the entire dashboard.
