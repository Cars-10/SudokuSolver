# Phase 5.5.3: Screensaver Issues

## Goal
Resolve remaining screensaver glitches and transitions.

## Objectives
1.  **Fix Transition Glitches:** Ensure smooth transition between normal view and screensaver (no flashes).
2.  **Verify Animation Logic:** Ensure Matrix rain and Puzzle overlay render correctly at all resolutions.
3.  **Handle Exit Gracefully:** Ensure exiting screensaver restores state perfectly (scroll position, focus).
4.  **Performance:** Ensure screensaver doesn't consume excessive CPU when active.

## Plan Breakdown
1.  Review `Metrics/report_client.js` screensaver code (canvas logic).
2.  Test entry/exit sequences.
3.  Optimize canvas drawing loop.
4.  Verify fix.

## Success Criteria
- Seamless entry/exit.
- visually perfect rendering.
- Low CPU usage (relative to complexity).
