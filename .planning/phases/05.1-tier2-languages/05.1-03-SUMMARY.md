# Phase 5.1 Plan 03: Groovy and Dart Summary

**Groovy and Dart solvers with exact algorithm match - all 10 matrix validations passed**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-18T13:29:24Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-18T13:32:23Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 8

## Accomplishments

- Implemented Groovy solver with @Field annotations for closure scope
- Implemented Dart solver with native Dart IO
- Both languages validated on all 5 matrices with correct iteration counts
- Groovy runs on JVM with Java interop
- Dart runs in JIT mode (can also compile to native)

## Files Created/Modified

- `Languages/Groovy/Sudoku.groovy` - Groovy solver implementation
- `Languages/Groovy/runMe.sh` - Benchmark runner script
- `Languages/Groovy/README.md` - Documentation with validation status
- `Languages/Groovy/metrics.json` - Benchmark metrics
- `Languages/Dart/Sudoku.dart` - Dart solver implementation
- `Languages/Dart/runMe.sh` - Benchmark runner script
- `Languages/Dart/README.md` - Documentation with validation status
- `Languages/Dart/metrics.json` - Benchmark metrics

## Decisions Made

- Used @Field annotation in Groovy for script-level variable access in closures
- Used Dart JIT mode for benchmarking (native compile option documented)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- Groovy closure scope: Script-level variables not accessible in closures without @Field annotation

## Next Phase Readiness

- 22 languages now complete (15 Tier 1 + 7 Tier 2)
- Ready for 05.1-04-PLAN.md (Julia, R)
- 8 Tier 2 languages remaining
