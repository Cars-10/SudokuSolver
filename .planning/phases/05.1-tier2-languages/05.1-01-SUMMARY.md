# Phase 5.1 Plan 01: Lua and Bash Solvers Summary

**Lua and Bash Sudoku solvers with exact C reference algorithm match - all 10 matrix validations passed**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~8 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-18T13:06:00Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-18T13:14:00Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Lua solver passes all 5 matrices with exact iteration counts
- Bash solver passes all 5 matrices with exact iteration counts (despite being ~500x slower than Lua)
- Both implementations follow exact brute-force algorithm: row-major scanning, 1-9 value order, count every attempt
- runMe.sh scripts using common.sh pattern with proper run_matrix override for multi-word SOLVER_BINARY

## Files Created/Modified

- `Languages/Lua/Sudoku.lua` - Complete Lua solver implementation
- `Languages/Lua/runMe.sh` - Benchmark runner with run_matrix override
- `Languages/Lua/README.md` - Documentation with validation table
- `Languages/BASH/Sudoku.sh` - Complete Bash solver implementation
- `Languages/BASH/runMe.sh` - Benchmark runner with run_matrix override
- `Languages/BASH/README.md` - Documentation with validation table

## Decisions Made

- Used 1-indexed arrays in Lua (native to Lua) with adjusted box calculation
- Used 1D array in Bash to simulate 9x9 grid (index = row*9 + col)
- Bash solver runs slower (~60s for largest matrices) but completes within timeout

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed SOLVER_BINARY quoting issue in runMe.sh**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Lua validation)
- **Issue:** common.sh quotes `$SOLVER_BINARY` which breaks multi-word commands like "lua Sudoku.lua"
- **Fix:** Override `run_matrix` function in language-specific runMe.sh (following JavaScript pattern)
- **Files modified:** Languages/Lua/runMe.sh, Languages/BASH/runMe.sh
- **Verification:** Both solvers produce correct metrics.json with iteration counts

### Deferred Enhancements

None - plan executed as specified.

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (blocking issue with shell quoting)
**Impact on plan:** Minor fix required for benchmark integration, no scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

None - both Lua and Bash executed successfully on all matrices.

## Next Phase Readiness

- 2 languages added to Tier 2 benchmark suite
- Ready for next plan (05.1-02: Haskell/OCaml or similar)
