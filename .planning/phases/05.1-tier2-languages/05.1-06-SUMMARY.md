# Phase 5.1 Plan 06: F# and Elixir Summary

**F# (.NET functional) and Elixir (Erlang VM) solvers with full 5-matrix validation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-18T13:55:09Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-18T14:00:59Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 10

## Accomplishments

- F# solver with .NET 9.0 project, exact algorithm match on all 5 matrices
- Elixir solver using Agent for mutable counter, full validation passed
- Both languages output matches C reference format exactly
- runMe.sh scripts following common.sh pattern for both

## Files Created/Modified

- `Languages/F_Sharp/Sudoku.fs` - F# solver implementation
- `Languages/F_Sharp/Sudoku.fsproj` - F# project file (net9.0)
- `Languages/F_Sharp/runMe.sh` - Benchmark script with custom run_matrix
- `Languages/F_Sharp/README.md` - Documentation
- `Languages/F_Sharp/metrics.json` - Validation results
- `Languages/Elixir/Sudoku.exs` - Elixir solver implementation
- `Languages/Elixir/runMe.sh` - Benchmark script
- `Languages/Elixir/README.md` - Documentation
- `Languages/Elixir/metrics.json` - Validation results

## Decisions Made

- Used .NET 9.0 for F# (matches installed SDK version)
- F# uses mutable variables for imperative algorithm matching
- Elixir uses Agent for mutable iteration counter (clean functional pattern)
- Both use tuple-based data structures for efficient access

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- F# initially targeted net8.0 but system has net9.0 - updated project file
- runMe.sh needed custom run_matrix override for dotnet/elixir execution

## Language Validation Results

### F# Validation
| Matrix | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 656 | 656 | ✓ Pass |
| 2 | 439,269 | 439,269 | ✓ Pass |
| 3 | 98,847 | 98,847 | ✓ Pass |
| 4 | 9,085 | 9,085 | ✓ Pass |
| 5 | 445,778 | 445,778 | ✓ Pass |

### Elixir Validation
| Matrix | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 656 | 656 | ✓ Pass |
| 2 | 439,269 | 439,269 | ✓ Pass |
| 3 | 98,847 | 98,847 | ✓ Pass |
| 4 | 9,085 | 9,085 | ✓ Pass |
| 5 | 445,778 | 445,778 | ✓ Pass |

**Notable:** Elixir performed much better than expected despite immutable data structures. The Erlang VM's tuple implementation with `put_elem` is quite efficient.

## Next Phase Readiness

- 28 of 30 Tier 1+2 languages complete
- Ready for 05.1-07-PLAN.md (Fortran, Ada - classic languages)
