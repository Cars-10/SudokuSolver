# Phase 5.3 Plan 3: V and Vala Solvers Summary

**V and Vala Sudoku solvers implemented with exact C algorithm match - both modern compiled languages validated on all 5 matrices**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~15 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-18T20:35:00Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-18T20:50:00Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 10

## Accomplishments

- Added V language (weekly.2025.51) and Vala (0.56.16) to Docker image
- Implemented V solver with struct-based design (globals require flags)
- Implemented Vala solver with GLib/GIO for file I/O
- Both languages pass all 5 matrix validations with exact iteration counts

## Files Created/Modified

- `server/Dockerfile` - Added V and Vala toolchain sections (#38, #39)
- `Languages/V/Sudoku.v` - V solver with struct-based design
- `Languages/V/runMe.sh` - V benchmark script with -prod flag
- `Languages/V/README.md` - V implementation documentation
- `Languages/Vala/Sudoku.vala` - Vala solver with GLib object model
- `Languages/Vala/runMe.sh` - Vala benchmark script with gio-2.0 package
- `Languages/Vala/README.md` - Vala implementation documentation
- `Languages/V/metrics.json` - V benchmark metrics
- `Languages/Vala/metrics.json` - Vala benchmark metrics

## Validation Results

### V Language

| Matrix | Expected | Actual  | Status |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1      | 656      | 656     | ✓ Pass |
| 2      | 439,269  | 439,269 | ✓ Pass |
| 3      | 98,847   | 98,847  | ✓ Pass |
| 4      | 9,085    | 9,085   | ✓ Pass |
| 5      | 445,778  | 445,778 | ✓ Pass |

### Vala Language

| Matrix | Expected | Actual  | Status |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1      | 656      | 656     | ✓ Pass |
| 2      | 439,269  | 439,269 | ✓ Pass |
| 3      | 98,847   | 98,847  | ✓ Pass |
| 4      | 9,085    | 9,085   | ✓ Pass |
| 5      | 445,778  | 445,778 | ✓ Pass |

## Decisions Made

- V: Used struct with mutable fields instead of globals (globals require `-enable-globals` flag)
- Vala: Linked `gio-2.0` package for File and DataInputStream classes
- Both: Iteration counter placed inside for loop, before is_valid() check (matching C exactly)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- V initially failed: V doesn't allow `__global` by default, rewrote to use struct-based approach
- Vala initially failed: Missing `using GLib;` and `--pkg gio-2.0` for file I/O classes
- Both issues resolved with standard fixes, no impact on validation

## Next Phase Readiness

- 45 languages now validated (Tier 1: 15, Tier 2: 15, Tier 3: 9, Tier 4: 6)
- Ready for 05.3-04-PLAN.md (Forth + Smalltalk)
- Docker image includes V and Vala toolchains
