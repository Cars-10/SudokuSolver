# Phase 5.3 Plan 2: Raku and Octave Summary

**Implemented Raku and GNU Octave solvers with exact algorithm match - all 5 matrices validated**

## Accomplishments

- Raku (Perl 6 successor) solver implemented with shaped arrays and modern syntax
- GNU Octave (MATLAB-compatible) solver implemented with 1-based indexing
- Both languages validated against C reference iteration counts
- Output format matches C reference exactly (spacing, headers, paths)
- READMEs created documenting validation status and language-specific details
- runMe.sh scripts using common.sh modular pattern
- metrics.json populated for both languages
- Docker image rebuilt with Raku (Rakudo) and Octave toolchains

## Files Created/Modified

### Docker
- `server/Dockerfile` - Added Raku (Rakudo) and GNU Octave sections

### Raku
- `Languages/Raku/Sudoku.raku` - Main solver (rewritten to match C algorithm exactly)
- `Languages/Raku/runMe.sh` - Benchmark script
- `Languages/Raku/README.md` - Documentation
- `Languages/Raku/metrics.json` - Benchmark results (generated)

### Octave
- `Languages/Octave/Sudoku.m` - Main solver (1-based indexing)
- `Languages/Octave/runMe.sh` - Benchmark script
- `Languages/Octave/README.md` - Documentation
- `Languages/Octave/metrics.json` - Benchmark results (generated)

## Validation Results

| Language | Matrix 1 | Matrix 2 | Matrix 3 | Matrix 4 | Matrix 5 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Raku     | 656 ✓    | 439,269 ✓| 98,847 ✓ | 9,085 ✓  | 445,778 ✓|
| Octave   | 656 ✓    | 439,269 ✓| 98,847 ✓ | 9,085 ✓  | 445,778 ✓|

## Performance Notes

- Raku (Rakudo): Interpreted with JIT, Matrix 5 completes in ~1-2 seconds
- Octave: Interpreted with JIT compilation, Matrix 5 completes in ~0.5-1 second
- Both demonstrate moderate performance typical of interpreted languages

## Decisions Made

- Used Raku's shaped array syntax `@puzzle[9;9]` with semicolon indexing
- Octave uses 1-based indexing throughout (box calculation adjusted accordingly)
- Both use global variables for puzzle state (idiomatic for these languages)
- Docker image rebuilt with --no-cache to ensure clean installation

## Deviations Encountered

**Deviation 1: Raku algorithm mismatch**
- Issue: Existing Sudoku.raku used pre-calculated next row/col approach, not find-first-empty
- Fix: Rewrote entire solver to match C reference (find first empty cell in row-major order)
- Impact: Critical - previous approach would have different iteration counts

**Deviation 2: Octave 1-based indexing**
- Issue: Octave uses 1-based arrays, not 0-based like C
- Fix: Adjusted all array access and box calculation formulas
- Impact: Algorithm preserved, just index translation

## Issues Encountered

None - both languages implemented successfully with exact algorithm match.

## Next Step

Phase 5.3 Plan 3: V and Vala solvers (modern compiled languages).
