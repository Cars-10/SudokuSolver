# Phase 5.3 Plan 01: CoffeeScript and Racket Summary

**CoffeeScript 2.7.0 (transpiled JS) and Racket 8.10 (modern Scheme) solvers validated with exact C algorithm match**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 18 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-18T19:33:42Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-18T19:52:29Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 9

## Accomplishments

- Added CoffeeScript and Racket toolchains to Docker image
- Fixed CoffeeScript solver: corrected iteration counting (before isValid, not after)
- Fixed Racket solver: corrected output format and path normalization
- Both languages pass all 5 matrix validations with exact iteration counts

## Files Created/Modified

- `server/Dockerfile` - Added Tier 4 language section (CoffeeScript via npm, Racket via apt)
- `Languages/CoffeeScript/Sudoku.coffee` - Rewritten with correct algorithm and output format
- `Languages/CoffeeScript/runMe.sh` - Created benchmark runner
- `Languages/CoffeeScript/README.md` - Created documentation
- `Languages/Racket/Sudoku.rkt` - Rewritten with correct output format
- `Languages/Racket/runMe.sh` - Created benchmark runner
- `Languages/Racket/README.md` - Created documentation
- `Languages/CoffeeScript/metrics.json` - Generated benchmark metrics
- `Languages/Racket/metrics.json` - Generated benchmark metrics

## Decisions Made

- Used flat vector (81 elements) for Racket grid instead of 2D array for simpler indexing

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- Racket compiled bytecode version mismatch (8.10 vs 8.17) - resolved by clearing /compiled directory
- tsx/esbuild architecture mismatch in Docker - used generate_report_simple.js instead

## Next Phase Readiness

- 41 languages now validated (39 previous + 2 new: CoffeeScript, Racket)
- Ready for 05.3-02-PLAN.md (Raku and Octave)
