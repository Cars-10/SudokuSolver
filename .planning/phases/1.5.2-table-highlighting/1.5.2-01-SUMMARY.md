# Phase 1.5.2 Plan 01: CSS Fix + Expandable Infrastructure Summary

**Eliminated table hover text shift by removing scale transforms and using transparent borders, added chevron expand indicators with click-to-expand rows showing System/Compilation/Matrix Results sections**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min (verification of pre-existing implementation)
- **Started:** 2025-12-17T20:48:06Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-17T20:53:35Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Fixed hover text shift by removing `transform: scale(1.01)` and using transparent borders that change color on hover
- Added chevron indicator (▶) to language column that rotates 90° when expanded
- Implemented click-to-expand functionality on language cells with proper event handling
- Created expandable row content with three organized sections displaying metrics data

## Files Created/Modified

- `Metrics/index.css` - Removed scale transform from hover, added transparent borders to `td`, added `.expand-chevron`, `.expanded-content`, `.expanded-sections`, `.section-title`, `.section-content` styles
- `Metrics/HTMLGenerator.ts` - Added chevron span to language column, added expanded content row after each data row with System/Compilation/Matrix Results sections
- `Metrics/report_client.js` - Added click handler on `.lang-col` to toggle `expanded` class and show/hide expanded content row

## Decisions Made

- Used CSS class toggle (`expanded`, `visible`) instead of inline style manipulation for cleaner code
- Matrix Results section displays actual data from metrics (time, iterations, memory per matrix)
- System and Compilation sections show placeholders for now - data capture enhancement deferred to Plan 02

## Deviations from Plan

None - implementation matched plan specifications exactly.

## Issues Encountered

None - all tasks completed successfully.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Expandable row infrastructure complete and functional
- Ready for 1.5.2-02-PLAN.md (Enhanced Table Columns) to add compiler version and memory peak columns
