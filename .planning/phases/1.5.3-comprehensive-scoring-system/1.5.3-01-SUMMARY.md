# Phase 1.5.3 Plan 01: Comprehensive Scoring System Summary

**Geometric mean scoring using 4 performance ratios (time, memory, iterations, CPU) - industry-standard method matching SPEC/Geekbench**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-18T07:40:39Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-18T07:45:30Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Replaced weighted average scoring with geometric mean formula
- Added iteration ratio as fourth scoring component
- Updated Scoring Methodology modal with clear formula explanation
- Added "Why Geometric Mean?" section explaining industry standard choice

## Files Created/Modified

- `Metrics/HTMLGenerator.ts` - Updated scoring calculation (lines 1509-1521) and methodology modal (lines 983-1027)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Geometric Mean | User selected from 5 options; industry standard (SPEC, Geekbench), prevents single metric dominance, penalizes imbalanced performance |
| Added iteration ratio | All 4 available metrics now contribute to score |
| Floor at 0.001 | Prevents zero/division issues in geometric mean |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- Scoring system complete with geometric mean
- Modal explains methodology clearly with formula, metrics, and interpretation
- Ready for Phase 2 or additional scoring enhancements
