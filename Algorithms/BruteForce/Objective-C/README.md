# Objective-C Sudoku Solver

## Requirements

**macOS:**
```bash
# Xcode command line tools (includes clang)
xcode-select --install
```

**Linux:**
```bash
apt install gnustep-devel gnustep-make gcc
```

## Notes

Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to C.

On macOS, the solver uses the native Foundation framework. On Linux, it uses GNUstep, a free implementation of the OpenStep (Cocoa) frameworks.
