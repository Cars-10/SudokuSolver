# GNU Smalltalk Sudoku Solver

## Requirements

**Via apt:**
```bash
apt install gnu-smalltalk
```

**Via Linuxbrew:**
```bash
brew install gnu-smalltalk
```

The runMe.sh automatically adds `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin` to PATH if available.

## Notes

GNU Smalltalk is a free implementation of the Smalltalk-80 language. The solver runs via the `gst` command (GNU Smalltalk interpreter).
