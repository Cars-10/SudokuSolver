prompt = "<objective>\nComprehensive research on HOW to implement a phase before planning.\n\nThis is for niche/complex domains where Gemini's training data is sparse or outdated. Research discovers:\n- What libraries exist for this problem\n- What architecture patterns experts use\n- What the standard stack looks like\n- What problems people commonly hit\n- What NOT to hand-roll (use existing solutions)\n\nOutput: RESEARCH.md with ecosystem knowledge that informs quality planning.\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/research-phase.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/research.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/references/research-pitfalls.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\nPhase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)\n\n**Load project state:**\n@.planning/STATE.md\n\n**Load roadmap:**\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n\n**Load phase context if exists:**\nCheck for `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-CONTEXT.md` - bonus context from discuss-phase.\n</context>\n\n<process>\n1. Validate phase number argument (error if missing or invalid)\n2. Check if phase exists in roadmap - extract phase description\n3. Check if RESEARCH.md already exists (offer to update or use existing)\n4. Load CONTEXT.md if it exists (bonus context for research direction)\n5. Follow research-phase.md workflow:\n   - Analyze phase to identify knowledge gaps\n   - Determine research domains (architecture, ecosystem, patterns, pitfalls)\n   - Execute comprehensive research via Context7, official docs, WebSearch\n   - Cross-verify all findings\n   - Create RESEARCH.md with actionable ecosystem knowledge\n6. Offer next steps (plan the phase)\n</process>\n\n<when_to_use>\n**Use research-phase for:**\n- 3D graphics (Three.js, WebGL, procedural generation)\n- Game development (physics, collision, AI, procedural content)\n- Audio/music (Web Audio API, DSP, synthesis)\n- Shaders (GLSL, Metal, ISF)\n- ML/AI integration (model serving, inference, pipelines)\n- Real-time systems (WebSockets, WebRTC, sync)\n- Specialized frameworks with active ecosystems\n- Any domain where \"how do experts do this\" matters\n\n**Skip research-phase for:**\n- Standard web dev (auth, CRUD, REST APIs)\n- Well-known patterns (forms, validation, testing)\n- Simple integrations (Stripe, SendGrid with clear docs)\n- Commodity features Gemini handles well\n</when_to_use>\n\n<success_criteria>\n- [ ] Phase validated against roadmap\n- [ ] Domain/ecosystem identified from phase description\n- [ ] Comprehensive research executed (Context7 + official docs + WebSearch)\n- [ ] All WebSearch findings cross-verified with authoritative sources\n- [ ] RESEARCH.md created with ecosystem knowledge\n- [ ] Standard stack/libraries identified\n- [ ] Architecture patterns documented\n- [ ] Common pitfalls catalogued\n- [ ] What NOT to hand-roll is clear\n- [ ] User knows next steps (plan phase)\n</success_criteria>"
