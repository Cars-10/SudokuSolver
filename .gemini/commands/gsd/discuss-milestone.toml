prompt = "<objective>\nHelp you figure out what to build in the next milestone through collaborative thinking.\n\nPurpose: After completing a milestone, explore what features you want to add, improve, or fix. Features first — scope and phases derive from what you want to build.\nOutput: Context gathered, then routes to /gsd:new-milestone\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-milestone.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\n**Load project state first:**\n@.planning/STATE.md\n\n**Load roadmap:**\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n\n**Load milestones (if exists):**\n@.planning/MILESTONES.md\n</context>\n\n<process>\n1. Verify previous milestone complete (or acknowledge active milestone)\n2. Present context from previous milestone (accomplishments, phase count)\n3. Follow discuss-milestone.md workflow with **ALL questions using AskUserQuestion**:\n   - Use AskUserQuestion: \"What do you want to add, improve, or fix?\" with feature categories\n   - Use AskUserQuestion to dig into features they mention\n   - Use AskUserQuestion to help them articulate what matters most\n   - Use AskUserQuestion for decision gate (ready / ask more / let me add context)\n4. Hand off to /gsd:new-milestone with gathered context\n\n**CRITICAL: ALL questions use AskUserQuestion. Never ask inline text questions.**\n</process>\n\n<success_criteria>\n\n- Project state loaded and presented\n- Previous milestone context summarized\n- Milestone scope gathered through adaptive questioning\n- Context handed off to /gsd:new-milestone\n  </success_criteria>"
