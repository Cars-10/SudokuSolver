prompt = "<objective>\nExecute a PLAN.md file with per-task atomic commits, create SUMMARY.md, update project state.\n\nCommit strategy:\n- Each task → 1 commit immediately after completion (feat/fix/test/refactor)\n- Plan completion → 1 metadata commit (docs: SUMMARY + STATE + ROADMAP)\n\nUses intelligent segmentation:\n- Plans without checkpoints → spawn subagent for full autonomous execution\n- Plans with verify checkpoints → segment execution, pause at checkpoints\n- Plans with decision checkpoints → execute in main context\n  </objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-plan.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/summary.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/references/checkpoints.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/references/tdd.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\nPlan path: $ARGUMENTS\n\n**Load project state first:**\n@.planning/STATE.md\n\n**Load workflow config:**\n@.planning/config.json\n</context>\n\n<process>\n1. Check .planning/ directory exists (error if not - user should run /gsd:new-project)\n2. Verify plan at $ARGUMENTS exists\n3. Check if SUMMARY.md already exists (plan already executed?)\n4. Load workflow config for mode (interactive/yolo)\n5. Follow execute-plan.md workflow:\n   - Parse plan and determine execution strategy (A/B/C)\n   - Execute tasks (via subagent or main context as appropriate)\n   - Handle checkpoints and deviations\n   - Create SUMMARY.md\n   - Update STATE.md\n   - Commit changes\n</process>\n\n<execution_strategies>\n**Strategy A: Fully Autonomous** (no checkpoints)\n\n- Spawn subagent to execute entire plan\n- Subagent creates SUMMARY.md and commits\n- Main context: orchestration only (~5% usage)\n\n**Strategy B: Segmented** (has verify-only checkpoints)\n\n- Execute in segments between checkpoints\n- Subagent for autonomous segments\n- Main context for checkpoints\n- Aggregate results → SUMMARY → commit\n\n**Strategy C: Decision-Dependent** (has decision checkpoints)\n\n- Execute in main context\n- Decision outcomes affect subsequent tasks\n- Quality maintained through small scope (2-3 tasks per plan)\n  </execution_strategies>\n\n<deviation_rules>\nDuring execution, handle discoveries automatically:\n\n1. **Auto-fix bugs** - Fix immediately, document in Summary\n2. **Auto-add critical** - Security/correctness gaps, add and document\n3. **Auto-fix blockers** - Can't proceed without fix, do it and document\n4. **Ask about architectural** - Major structural changes, stop and ask user\n5. **Log enhancements** - Nice-to-haves, log to ISSUES.md, continue\n\nOnly rule 4 requires user intervention.\n</deviation_rules>\n\n<commit_rules>\n**Per-Task Commits:**\n\nAfter each task completes:\n1. Stage only files modified by that task\n2. Commit with format: `{type}({phase}-{plan}): {task-name}`\n3. Types: feat, fix, test, refactor, perf, chore\n4. Record commit hash for SUMMARY.md\n\n**Plan Metadata Commit:**\n\nAfter all tasks complete:\n1. Stage planning artifacts only: PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, STATE.md, ROADMAP.md\n2. Commit with format: `docs({phase}-{plan}): complete [plan-name] plan`\n3. NO code files (already committed per-task)\n\n**NEVER use:**\n- `git add .`\n- `git add -A`\n- `git add src/` or any broad directory\n\n**Always stage files individually.**\n\nSee ./.gemini/get-shit-done/references/git-integration.md for full commit strategy.\n</commit_rules>\n\n<success_criteria>\n\n- [ ] All tasks executed\n- [ ] Each task committed individually (feat/fix/test/refactor)\n- [ ] SUMMARY.md created with substantive content and commit hashes\n- [ ] STATE.md updated (position, decisions, issues, session)\n- [ ] ROADMAP updated (plan count, phase status)\n- [ ] Metadata committed with docs({phase}-{plan}): complete [plan-name] plan\n- [ ] User informed of next steps\n      </success_criteria>"
