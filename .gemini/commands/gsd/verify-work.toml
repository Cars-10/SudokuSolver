prompt = "<objective>\nGuide the user through manual acceptance testing of recently built features.\n\nPurpose: Validate that what Gemini thinks was built actually works from the user's perspective. The USER performs all testing — Gemini generates the test checklist, guides the process, and captures issues.\n\nOutput: Validation of features, any issues logged to phase-scoped ISSUES.md\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-work.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/uat-issues.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\nScope: $ARGUMENTS (optional)\n- If provided: Test specific phase or plan (e.g., \"4\" or \"04-02\")\n- If not provided: Test most recently completed plan\n\n**Load project state:**\n@.planning/STATE.md\n\n**Load roadmap:**\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n</context>\n\n<process>\n1. Validate arguments (if provided, parse as phase or plan number)\n2. Find relevant SUMMARY.md (specified or most recent)\n3. Follow verify-work.md workflow:\n   - Extract testable deliverables\n   - Generate test checklist\n   - Guide through each test via AskUserQuestion\n   - Collect and categorize issues\n   - Log issues to `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-ISSUES.md`\n   - Present summary with verdict\n4. Offer next steps based on results:\n   - If all passed: Continue to next phase\n   - If issues found: `/gsd:plan-fix {phase} {plan}` to create fix plan\n</process>\n\n<anti_patterns>\n- Don't run automated tests (that's for CI/test suites)\n- Don't make assumptions about test results — USER reports outcomes\n- Don't skip the guidance — walk through each test\n- Don't dismiss minor issues — log everything user reports\n- Don't fix issues during testing — capture for later\n</anti_patterns>\n\n<success_criteria>\n- [ ] Test scope identified from SUMMARY.md\n- [ ] Checklist generated based on deliverables\n- [ ] User guided through each test\n- [ ] All test results captured (pass/fail/partial/skip)\n- [ ] Any issues logged to phase-scoped ISSUES.md (not global)\n- [ ] Summary presented with verdict\n- [ ] User knows next steps based on results\n</success_criteria>"
