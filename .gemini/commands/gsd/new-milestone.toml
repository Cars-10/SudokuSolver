prompt = "<objective>\nCreate a new milestone for an existing project with defined phases.\n\nPurpose: After completing a milestone (or when ready to define next chunk of work), creates the milestone structure in ROADMAP.md with phases, updates STATE.md, and creates phase directories.\nOutput: New milestone in ROADMAP.md, updated STATE.md, phase directories created\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/create-milestone.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/roadmap.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\nMilestone name: $ARGUMENTS (optional - will prompt if not provided)\n\n**Load project state first:**\n@.planning/STATE.md\n\n**Load roadmap:**\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n\n**Load milestones (if exists):**\n@.planning/MILESTONES.md\n</context>\n\n<process>\n1. Load project context (STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, MILESTONES.md)\n2. Calculate next milestone version and starting phase number\n3. If milestone name provided in arguments, use it; otherwise prompt\n4. Gather phases (per depth setting: quick 3-5, standard 5-8, comprehensive 8-12):\n   - If called from /gsd:discuss-milestone, use provided context\n   - Otherwise, prompt for phase breakdown\n5. Detect research needs for each phase\n6. Confirm phases (respect config.json gate settings)\n7. Follow create-milestone.md workflow:\n   - Update ROADMAP.md with new milestone section\n   - Create phase directories\n   - Update STATE.md for new milestone\n   - Git commit milestone creation\n8. Offer next steps (discuss first phase, plan first phase, review)\n</process>\n\n<success_criteria>\n\n- Next phase number calculated correctly (continues from previous milestone)\n- Phases defined per depth setting (quick: 3-5, standard: 5-8, comprehensive: 8-12)\n- Research flags assigned for each phase\n- ROADMAP.md updated with new milestone section\n- Phase directories created\n- STATE.md reset for new milestone\n- Git commit made\n- User knows next steps\n  </success_criteria>"
